<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE POST-RAV ASHI AMORAIM: TRANSITION OR CONTINUITY? A STUDY OF THE ROLE OF THE FINAL GENERATIONS OF AMORAIM IN THE REDACTION OF THE TALMUD by RICHARD KALMIN The problem of the redaction of the Talmud, the final stages of the process by which the document before us assumed its present shape, is one which every student of the Talmud must eventually face. Resolution of this problem is by no means a matter of mere historical curiosity. Knowledge of who the redactors were, at what time period (or time periods) they lived, and how they reworked their sources, is indispensable for full comprehension both of these component sources and of the final product into which they have been combined. However, it was observed long ago that the Talmud maintains a remarkable silence about its process of formation.' Nor do sources external 1.

The few relevant works were composed hundreds of years after the events they describe, and their accounts are often obscure and contradictory.2 This is not, however, to say that we can know nothing at all about redac- tion. I hope to show in the course of this paper that we can know a great deal. It is only to say that we will be disappointed if we approach our sources expecting clear and explicit statements on this matter. We must rely instead on inference and implication, building upon the few glimpses we are granted behind what one commentator has referred to as "the walls of the closed editorial chambers of the Talmud."3 The picture I have presented of the limitations inherent in any account of the final editing of the Talmud would, I think, be agreed upon by most scholars working in the field today. This consensus, however, is of relatively recent vintage. Prior generations of scholars, even within the present cen- tury, were not beset by such doubts. These earlier scholars, largely through the influence of Rashi and the Rambam, took for granted the idea that Ray Ashi (d. 427 C.E.)4 edited the Talmud.5 Several nineteenth- and early- 2. For example, Seder Tannaim ve-Amoraim, ed. Kalman Kahan (Frankfurt am Main: Hermon, 1935), p. 9, and Iggeret Rav Sherira Gaon, ed. B. Lewin (Haifa, 1921), p. 69, present contradictory accounts of the extent of the saboraic contribution to the Talmud. 3. Kaplan, Redaction of the Babylonian Talmud, p. 104. 4. The dates utilized throughout this study are based on Seder Tannaim ve-Amoraim, ed. Kahan, and Iggeret Rav Sherira Gaon, ed. Lewin. (The date we are utilizing for the death of Rav Ashi is found on p. 5 of the former work [see note 104 there], and on p. 94 of the latter work.) The dates provided by post-talmudic sources for the deaths of talmudic rabbis are impossible to verify in their exact details. However, it is possible in most instances to compare the geonic chronology with that reflected by the internal evidence of the Talmud itself and to arrive at reliable conclusions regarding the proper sequence of these amoraim and their rela- tionship to one another. We have utilized the traditional dates, while remaining cognizant of their limitations. 5. This traditional view, it has often been claimed, was expressed even earlier by Rav Sherira in his famous Iggeret. However, already in the nineteenth century, Heinrich Graetz noticed that Rav Sherira nowhere refers to Rav Ashi as the editor of the Talmud. See Graetz's Geschichte der Juden (1853-75; rpt. Leipzig: O. Leiner, 1873-1900), 4:377.

Other major medieval proponents of the view that Rav Ashi edited the Talmud include Rav Nissim Gaon in his introduction to Sefer ha-Mafte'ah, Rav Natan Av ha-Yeshiva in his Perush Shishah Sidrei Mishnah, R. Shmuel ha-Nagid in his Mavo ha-Talmud, Rashbam on Bava Batra 130b, Tosafot on Hullin 2b, Sefer ha-Kritut, and Meiri in his introduction to Avot.</page><page sequence="3">THE POST-RAV ASHI AMORAIM 159 twentieth-century scholars, notably Zacharias Frankel and Isaac Halevy, went beyond the traditional theory in positing the existence of earlier layers of amoraic redaction within the Talmud.6 Nevertheless, even these scholars argued vigorously on behalf of the traditional conception of Rav Ashi's unique role in the final editing of the Talmud. In fact, it is no exaggeration to claim that "the overall picture of the redaction of BT [the Babylonian Talmud] is identical from the eleventh to the twentieth century."' Over the past several decades, however, the traditional theory has come under severe criticism. Julius Kaplan was the first to deny that Rav Ashi played the pivotal role in the final editing of the Talmud, observing that if Rav Ashi was the critical figure in such an undertaking, then something should uniquely mark him out as an editor.8 He should not merely conduct himself as an amora like any other amora.9 Kaplan demonstrated that the traditional conception of Rav Ashi as editor of the Talmud is totally without foundation, since "there is nothing to distinguish R. Ashi's contributions [sic] as material contributed by an editor."10 Kaplan's conclusion was inde- pendently corroborated by Abraham Weiss," and is now accepted by the overwhelming majority of modern scholars. If Rav Ashi did not edit the Talmud, however, then who did? Three major theories have been advanced in answer to this question. The first Some modern proponents of the view that Rav Ashi edited the Talmud include Solomon Rapoport, Erekh Milin (Prague, 1852), s.v.

No unique role in this editorial process was played by Rav Ashi or any other individual amora." This theory will be referred to as the theory of continu- ous redaction (see Table 2).16 The third theory, set forth by David Halivni, attributes the redaction of the Talmud to the authorities who lived after the death of Rav Ashi in 427 C.E.'7 This work continued until the beginning of the saboraic period, which Halivni dates to either 501 or 520 C.E.18 This theory will be referred to 12. Kaplan, Redaction of the Babylonian Talmud, pp. 297-308. However, it must be noted that Kaplan is not consistent on this matter.

At times (p. 3) he refers to "a Talmud" that was before the final editors of the Talmud, and at other times (pp. 5 and 14) he refers to "various editions" that were before the final editors of the Talmud. He does not specify, however, when he thinks these amoraic redactions took place. 15. However, in Albeck's earlier work, he accepts the traditional view of Rav Ashi's unique role in the final editing of the Talmud. See Hanokh Albeck, "La-Arikhat ha-Talmud ha-Bavli," Sefer Zikaron la-Asher Gulak u-le-Shmuel Klein (Jerusalem: Hebrew University Press Association, 1942), p. 2. 16.

Epstein, Mevo'ot le-Sifrut ha-Amoraim (Tel Aviv: Dvir, 1962), p. 12, who asserts that Rav Ashi and Ravina "gathered all of the material that preceded them ... explained it, completed it, and arranged it," and that this activity of explanation, completion, and arrangement continued during the two amoraic generations between the death of Rav Ashi and Ravina and the beginning of the saboraic period. The saboraim, claims Epstein, made only superficial changes to the Talmud basically completed by the amoraim. Epstein, however, does not develop these ideas further, nor does he attempt to supply proof for them. 18. The former (501 C.E.) is the date assigned by Rav Sherira in Iggeret Ray Sherira Gaon, ed. Lewin, p. 95, and Seder Tannaim ve-Amoraim, ed. Kahan, p. 6, for the death of the later Ravina, which both geonic sources identify as the point at which hora'ah ended. The latter (520</page><page sequence="5">THE POST-RAV ASHI AMORAIM 161 as the theory of stammaitic redaction, for reasons that will become apparent (see Table 2). It should be noted at the outset that there are two major aspects to the problem of the redaction of the Talmud. The first concerns the question of when the tannaitic and amoraic statements that make up the sugya's basic source material were arranged in their present order. The arrangement of sources in a particular order is one important factor determining our under- standing of the relationship between those sources, and is therefore editorial in character. The question is whether this arrangement was done all at once, late in the talmudic period, or whether it was a process that continued throughout the entire amoraic period. This aspect of the problem of redac- tion will not concern us in the present study, however, since our research yielded no basis upon which to decide this question, and since the arrange- ment of material in the sugya is not a major point of contention between the three theories outlined above.'9 The basic difference between these theories concerns the second aspect of the problem of the redaction of the Talmud, namely, the question of when, and by whom, the anonymous layer of the Talmud, the stam, was com- posed.20 In this anonymous layer, the amoraic and tannaitic strata of the C.E.) appears to be the date assigned by Rav Sherira (accepting the interpretation of Halevy, Dorot ha-Rishonim, 3:26) for the death of Ray Yose (or Ray Assi), whom he enumerates among the amoraim. (See Iggeret Ray Sherira Gaon, p. 97. Compare p. 70 there, where Ray Sherira refers to Ray Yose as a sabora.) Seder Tannaim ve-Amoraim begins its account of the saboraim immediately after recounting the death of the above-mentioned Ravina, while Rav Sherira begins his account of the saboraim immediately after recounting the death of Ray Yose. It is therefore unclear, based on the geonic sources, exactly when the saboraic period began. Due to the fact that we are almost entirely dependent upon the geonim for our knowledge of this period, we have at present no choice but to treat the approximate date for the beginning of the saboraic period as a matter of doubt. 19. Klein, in "Some General Results of the Separation of Gemara from Sebara," credits Rav Ashi with the first compilation of the amoraic sections of the Talmud in association with the Mishnah. See also Kaplan, Redaction of the Babylonian Talmud, p. 289, according to which Ray Ashi is credited with "perfecting the gemara [the amoraic sections of the Talmud] in substance and extent." Kaplan does not make clear what the exact nature of Ray Ashi's role in perfecting the gemara was, although from his brief description it does not seem to have in- cluded the arrangement of material. According to Klein, the Talmud as edited by Rav Ashi consisted entirely of "gemara," i.e., of tersely formulated statements without proof-texts or argumentation. In his earlier work, Klein expressed uncertainty as to the identity of the compilers of gemara, and even in the above-cited source, he offers no proof for his contention, and his conclusion is only tentative. 20. See, for example, Sefer ha-Kritut, who writes that winx ix x n l n x xynn xv xi, tIp 1n)pn t vxn mx,'n ,,nvinx. That is, according to Sefer ha-Kritut, Rav Ashi and Ravina, the</page><page sequence="6">162 RICHARD KALMIN Talmud are analyzed, explicated, and, when necessary, emended and com- pleted, all of which is standard editorial activity (see Table 1). Consequent- ly, to say that the stam was authored by the saboraim is in effect to say that the saboraim edited the Talmud. To say that the stam derives from all amoraic generations is in effect to say that redaction was carried out in every generation.21 According to the view that the Talmud was edited during the editors of the Talmud, are responsible for all objections that are not explicitly attributed to an amora. See also Tosafot on flullin 2b. Among modern scholars, see Halevy, Dorot ha-Rishonim, 2:551, who writes that the con- sensus among scholars of his day was that all of the stam dates from the time of the final editing (the "sealing") of the Talmud. Even Halevy, who maintains the existence of early stamot, sees these early stamot as evidence of earlier amoraic editings prior to the final "sealing" of the Talmud by Rav Ashi. See note 165 there. See also Meyer Feldblum, "The Impact of the 'Anonymous Sugya' on Halakic Concepts," Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research 37 (1969): 19-28. In discussing the traditional view of the redaction of the Talmud, he writes, "The prevalent Rabbinic view.. . assumes a uniform redaction of the Talmud com- pleted by the close of the fifth century. ... This view is rooted in the Talmudic statement, Rav Ashi and Ravina are the end of Hora'ah, on the basis of which responsibility for the anony- mous material is ascribed to Rav Ashi and Ravina." That is, according to Feldblum, in identi- fying the redactors of the Talmud, we have also identified the authors of the stam. See also Mordechai Tenenblatt, Ha-Talmud ha-Bavli be-Hithavuto ha-Historit (Tel Aviv: Dvir, 1972), pp. 86 and 89, for his discussion of the theories of S. M. Rubinstein. See also Goodblatt, "Babylonian Talmud," pp. 154 ff. However, Shama Friedman, "Al Derekh .Heker ha-Sugya," Perek ha-Isha Rabbah ba-Bavli (Jerusalem: Jewish Theological Seminary, 1978), p. 20, addendum to n. 9, observes that it cannot be claimed that the opinion of Sefer ha-Kritut (see above) is a view held in common by all Rishonim. 21. Mention should also be made of the theory of Abraham Weiss. See the reference to Weiss's work cited in n. 5 above, and see his Ha- Ye;irah shel ha-Saboraim (Jerusalem: Hebrew University, 1953), pp. 1-18. Weiss's later view, expressed in the latter work, is shared by his disciple, Meyer Feldblum. See his "Impact of the 'Anonymous Sugya' on Halakhic Concepts" and also his summary of Weiss's work, "Prof. Avraham Weiss: Ha-Arakhat Darko be-HIeker ha-Talmud ve-Sikum Maskanotav," in Sefer ha-Yovel li-Kevod ha-Rav Dr. Abraham Weiss (New York: Shulsinger Bros., 1964), pp. 34-41, and 50-52. It is difficult to evaluate the impact that our research into the post-Rav Ashi amoraim will have on Weiss's theory. Dr. Michael Chernick, in a telephone conversation that took place on March 1, 1985, informed me that late in Weiss's career, when speaking of the saboraic element in the Talmud, Weiss was referring less to the material produced during a particular time period than to material possessing certain stylistic features that distinguish it from amoraic material. Nevertheless, in his published work, Weiss never retracted the view he expressed in Hithavvut ha- Talmud bi-Shelemuto, pp. 254 ff., according to which the final generations of amoraim lived during a period of persecutions-persecutions which gradually increased in intensity as the fifth century progressed, bringing about the gradual reduction of amoraic creativity during this period until its final elimination by the beginning of the sixth century. Weiss's expansion of the usual meaning of the term"saboraic" thus entailed the blurring of the traditional distinction between the saboraic and geonic contributions to the Talmud. It did not entail a blurring of the</page><page sequence="7">THE POST-RAV ASHI AMORAIM 163 post-Rav Ashi amoraic period, by contrast, the stam was the work of the sages who lived between the death of Rav Ashi and the beginning of the saboraic period. These sages are referred to by Halivni as stammaim, since all of their activity was carried out anonymously. Some of the stammaim, however, functioned in a dual capacity as both stammaim and amoraim. In addition to their role in the anonymous editing of the Talmud, they were also active as named amoraim. It is these latter "stammaitic amoraim" that form the major subject of this paper.22 distinction between the saboraic and late amoraic contributions to the Talmud. That is, when Weiss uses the term "saboraic," it seems legitimate to assume that he does not mean to include material produced before the death of the last amora. In Weiss's early writings, he limited the saboraic contribution to literary polishing, to adding explanatory comments, improving the connecting links between elements within a sugya, between one sugya and another, and the like. Accordingly, most of the stam would have to be considered an amoraic creation, and would not be confined to any one particular genera- tion within the amoraic period. With regard to the date for the composition of the stam, there- fore, Weiss's early view closely resembles the view of Hanokh Albeck. Any arguments we make for or against the theory of Albeck therefore apply with basically the same force to the early Weiss. In Weiss's later writings, he attributes a much more extensive role to the saboraim. In addi- tion to attributing to them the literary polishing described above, he claims that they were responsible for the first, and in many cases for the second sugyot in every tractate. Such sugyot are often predominantly anonymous, or at least the framework within which the amoraic and tannaitic material appears is anonymous. He claims further that saboraic sugyot bearing "similar marks of lateness" are found throughout the entire Talmud, even though in most cases it is not possible to definitively prove their saboraic provenance. Although Weiss stops short of claiming that all of the stam is saboraic, his later view is clearly no more than a step removed from the view of Kaplan with regard to the saboraic role in the creation of the stam. Kaplan himself does not think that all that is anonymous in the Talmud is saboraic. At one point (p. 316), he writes that "there is nothing anomalous about the presence of Saboraic passages in the Talmud. They are numerous and varied and make up a goodly portion of the anonymous element in that work" (emphasis added). Any arguments we make for or against Kaplan's theories regarding the stam will apply with basically the same force to the theory of the later Weiss. According to the latter, no less than according to the former, we would not expect the unique characteristics of the post-Rav Ashi amoraim to indi- cate their role in the anonymous editing of the Talmud, nor would we expect the stam commen- tary based on these amoraim to be qualitatively different from the stam based on earlier amoraic generations (since in both cases, most of the stam is not contemporary with its sources). In our critique of the various theories regarding redaction, therefore, we have not found it necessary to treat Weiss's theories separately. For our purposes, the differences between Weiss's views and the views of other scholars are of negligible importance. 22. We will see later on that there were a small number of post-Rav Ashi amoraim who acted in several respects as typical amoraim. A full treatment of these amoraim cannot be pro- vided in the context of the present paper, since such a treatment would add inordinately to the length and complexity of our discussion. Suffice it to say that between forty-six and fifty-</page><page sequence="8">164 RICHARD KALMIN The traditional conception that Ray Ashi edited the Talmud by and large obscured the view of the post-Ray Ashi amoraic period held by earlier scholars.23 Since such a crucial role in the completion of the Talmud had been assigned to Ray Ashi, the two or more generations from his death until the beginning of the saboraic period had to be seen as basically a postscript, or as the time during which the finishing touches were put on the editorial project begun by Ray Ashi. Even after the theory of Ray Ashi as editor had been refuted, the earlier conception of the period following his death as an uncreative void persisted.24 It is undeniable that a relatively small number of attributed statements have survived from this period.25 However, I will attempt in this paper to demonstrate that despite the paucity of attributed material produced by the post-Ray Ashi amoraim, they are of crucial importance. I will attempt to show that by evaluating their statements, it is possible to make significant four post-Rav Ashi amoraim exhibit several characteristics that set them apart from amoraim in general (see Table 2), and thus fall in the category of "stammaitic amoraim," while only five to seven act as typical amoraim. It is clear that the latter group, such a small minority, cannot be viewed as representative of the period as a whole. Cf. below, n. 26. In addition, see the present writer's doctoral dissertation, The Post-Rav Ashi Amoraim: Transition or Continuity? A Study of the Role of the Final Generations of Amoraim in the Redaction of the Talmud (Ann Arbor: University Microfilms International, 1985), pp. 259-287, for a fuller discussion of this issue. 23. See, for example, Halevy, Dorot ha-Rishonim, 3:20 ff., who maintains that the amoraim after Rav Ashi added virtually nothing that was independent and original. See also Kaplan, Redaction of the Babylonian Talmud, pp. 3-27, and Herman Blumberg, "Heinrich Graetz and Ze'ev Jawitz," Shamai Kanter, "I. H. Weiss and J. S. Zuri," and David Goodblatt, "Y. I. Halevy," in The Formation of the Babylonian Talmud, pp. 3-47, for outlines of the major nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century theories concerning the redaction of the Talmud. 24. For example, in Benjamin DeVries, Mavo le-Sifrut ha-Talmudit (Tel Aviv: Sinai, 1966), pp. 98-107, the post-Rav Ashi amoraim completely disappear from view. On p. 104, in his account of the editing and arrangement of the Talmud, he passes from the generation of Rav Ashi and his colleagues to the "end of the fifth century," i.e., the beginning of the saboraic period. 25. See Halevy, Dorot ha-Rishonim, 3:21, who notes that the material composed after the death of Rav Ashi amounts to less than one-third of a talmudic tractate. While Halevy's observation is extremely imprecise, his basic insight regarding the sudden dropping-off in amoraic material produced after the death of Rav Ashi is correct. See also Weiss, Hithavvut ha-Talmud bi-Shelemuto, p. 256, and n. 117, and Hyman Klein, "Gemara Quotations in Sebara," Jewish Quarterly Review 43 (1953): 344-345, n. 8. Halivni, Mekorot u-Mesorot, intro- duction to Yoma-Hagigah, p. 7, notes that the period between the death of Rav Ashi in 427 and the death of the later Ravina in 501 represents approximately one-third of the total duration of the amoraic period, and claims that the material which can be dated with certainty to this period adds up to less than 5 percent of the total amoraic contribution to the Talmud.</page><page sequence="9">THE POST-RAV ASHI AMORAIM 165 progress toward determining which theory regarding the redaction of the Talmud is correct. If Halivni is correct that the post-Rav Ashi amoraim were among the redactors of the Talmud, there should be something distinc- tive and non-amoraic about them. That is, Kaplan's insight concerning Rav Ashi's supposed editorial activity should apply with equal force to the post-Ray Ashi amoraim. We know that Rabbi Judah the Prince (Rabbi) was the editor of the Mishnah because (1) sages who were Rabbi's near con- temporaries say so, (2) Rabbi and his contemporaries are only very seldom mentioned in the Mishnah, and (3) sages who lived after Rabbi are virtually nonexistent in the Mishnah. Thus we find factors which clearly set Rabbi and his generation apart from other generations of tannaim. If the post- Rav Ashi amoraim were, at least in part, the editors of the Talmud, we would expect to find comparable factors distinguishing them from amoraim in general. By contrast, according to the theory of saboraic redaction, we would expect to find no fundamental differences between the post-Rav Ashi amoraim and previous generations of amoraim.26 According to this theory, any distinctive features we encounter among the post-Rav Ashi amoraim should be in line with discernible amoraic trends. That is, we should observe a smooth transition from the generation of Rav Ashi and his contempo- raries to the generation of Rav Ashi's students and beyond. Similarly, according to the theory of continuous redaction, we would not expect the activity of the post-Rav Ashi amoraim to be uniquely suggestive of an editorial role on their part.27 If redactional activity was taking place in every generation, then why should the role of the post-Rav Ashi amoraim in this process stand out with any special clarity? In order to determine which theory has more adequately predicted the 26. See Kaplan, Redaction of the Babylonian Talmud, pp. 146-147. Kaplan evidently believes that statements by Rav Aha and Ravina, which he correctly concludes are typical of amoraic statements in general, are characteristic of the post-Rav Ashi amoraic period as a whole. We have found, however, that the statements of these two amoraim are uncharacteristic of statements by the overwhelming majority of post-Rav Ashi amoraim. See above, n. 21, and the references cited there. 27. Hanokh Albeck, in "Sof ha-Hora'ah ve-Siyyum ha-Talmud," Sinai, Sefer Yovel (Jerusalem: Mosad ha-Rav Kook, 1958), pp. 73-79, argues that the post-Rav Ashi amoraim are unique only in that they appear very infrequently in the Talmud and do not interpret tannaitic sources. (See Kalmin, Post-Ray Ashi Amoraim, pp. 92-98, where I refute Albeck's claim that the post-Rav Ashi amoraim do not interpret tannaitic sources.) Albeck certainly assigns to the post-Rav Ashi amoraim no special editorial role.</page><page sequence="10">166 RICHARD KALMIN behavior of the post-Ray Ashi amoraim, I will show in this paper that the attributional material that survived from the post-Ray Ashi period con- forms to clearly definable patterns, and that these patterns are atypical of those exhibited by previous amoraic generations. I will attempt to evaluate whether or not the distinctive features of the post-Ray Ashi amoraim are such as would suggest their activity as editors.28 I will also examine the relationship between the post-Ray Ashi amoraim and the anonymous sections of the Talmud. It has convincingly been claimed that several of the characteristic features of the stam vis-a-vis earlier amoraim confront the theory of continuous redaction with perhaps its most serious difficulty.29 For example, it is highly typical for the stam to interpret earlier sources in a forced manner, and it has been suggested that this characteristic is attributable in large part to the length of time separat- ing the stam from its sources. It is reasonable to assume that the level of forced interpretations would be dramatically reduced if the stam were con- temporary with the amoraim whose statements it was explicating. A con- temporary would be able to ask the amora personally what his meaning was, and would not be forced to rely on his own independent understanding. It follows that if the stam was composed between 427 and the beginning of the saboraic period, as Halivni claims, we would expect to find very little evidence of chronological distance between the stam and the post-Ray Ashi amoraim, due to the fact that they are contemporaries (see Table 2). According to the theory of saboraic redaction, however, we would expect evidence of chronological distance between the stam and the post- Ray Ashi amoraim to be more prevalent. While the length of time separat- ing the stam from the post-Ray Ashi amoraim would be less according to 28. Mention should also be made of Shama Friedman's view of the redaction of the Talmud (see Friedman, "Al Derekh Heker ha-Sugya," pp. 17-18, esp. n. 42). Friedman, who relies heavily on the theories of Hyman Klein, observes that in all of the talmudic material he has analyzed thus far, the stam always postdates the amoraic layer of the sugya. Friedman does not commit himself with regard to the question of whether the stam was composed entirely during the saboraic period, or whether its composition began already during the amoraic period. He points out that Klein himself did not explicitly identify the saboraim as the authors of the stam until the very end of his career. See, for example, "Gemara and Sebara," Jewish Quarterly Review 38 (1947/48): 70, n. 10, where Klein claims that the periods of gemara and sebara over- lap. Our research, therefore, will not affect the substance of Friedman's postion but will serve to decide an issue concerning which he expressed uncertainty: the approximate date for the begin- ning of the composition of the stam. 29.

By examining the stam commentary on statements by the post-Rav Ashi amoraim, therefore, it might be possible to determine whether the theory of saboraic redaction or the theory of stammaitic redaction has more accurately predicted the nature of that commentary. It might be possible to determine whether the stam dates from the saboraic period or from the post-Ray Ashi amoraic period. Before I move on to an analysis of the statements by the post-Ray Ashi amoraim, and of the stam commentary on those statements, a few addi- tional introductory remarks are required. It is important to note, firstly, how this study differs from previous attempts on the same subject. It differs from them first of all in that it makes the post-Ray Ashi amoraic period its primary focus rather than treating the period as one relatively unimportant aspect of the problem of the formation of the Talmud as a whole.30 It differs from them secondly in that it attempts to be comprehensive.3' Finally, it differs from previous studies in that it has at its disposal the methods and conclusions of modern critical talmudic scholarship.32 While many of these methods were already known and utilized sporadi- cally by early medieval commentators on the Babylonian Talmud,33 they have, over the past several decades, been developed, refined, and applied systematically by modern scholars. It is by now axiomatic among the majority of Talmud scholars that not everything that is presently attributed to a particular authority was actually said by him. It can often be demon- strated by means of modern critical analysis that later, usually unidentified 30. See, however, Avinoam Cohen, Mar bar Rav Ashi and His Literary Contribution (Ann Arbor: University Microfilms International, 1980). Although Cohen's primary interest is in Mar bar Rav Ashi, he attempts in several places to generalize about the period as a whole. He suggests that the statements of Mar bar Rav Ashi might be characteristic of the post-Rav Ashi amoraic period as a whole. However, we found repeatedly that the activity of Mar bar Rav Ashi is atypical of the period as a whole. See Kalmin, Post-Rav Ashi Amoraim, pp. 348-352 and pp. 517-522, for an analysis of Cohen's work. See also below. 31. Albeck, "Sof ha-Hora'ah ve-Siyyum ha-Talmud," pp. 73-79, makes the post-Rav Ashi amoraim its primary focus, but treats only a tiny selection of the available material. 32. Cohen's study (see above, n. 30), which owes much to the thought of Abraham Weiss, is once again an exception to this generalization. Nevertheless, substantial differences exist be- tween the methodology employed in Cohen's work and that employed by Halivni and his students (including the present writer). Analysis of the differences between the methodology of Weiss and Halivni has only recently begun. See Semeia 27 (Chico, Calif.: Scholars Press, 1983). 33. See Friedman, "Al Derekh Heker ha-Sugya," pp. 12 ff.</page><page sequence="12">168 RICHARD KALMIN authorities have added to a statement, modifying or even completely over- turning its original meaning. It follows that at least part of what earlier studies assumed to have been said by post-Ray Ashi amoraim is in actuality a later superimposition onto their original statements. It likewise follows that a considerable part of the task involved in analyzing these statements consists of separating out the later layer of accretion in order to retrieve the original core. It is also important to note that a substantial number of statements by sages whom we have included within the post-Ray Ashi period were in actuality made prior to the death of Ray Ashi in 427, while those sages were still Ray Ashi's students. Even though such statements do not derive from the post-Ray Ashi period per se, they are nevertheless of crucial importance for a proper evaluation of statements by post-Ray Ashi amoraim made after Ray Ashi's death. They will therefore figure prominently in our statis- tics. Finally, it is important to note that at the center of this study is a division of the statements by post-Ray Ashi amoraim into apodictic and argumenta- tional categories. The term "apodictic" was first applied to Jewish sources by Alexander Alt in the field of biblical law.34 Alt contrasted apodictic law, which is absolute and categorical, with casuistic law, which is tied to a parti- cular situation, conditional, and introduced by an "if" clause (protasis), with the legal penalty for the action expressed as the consequence (apodosis). Subsequent studies in the field of Bible have taken issue with Alt's account of the origins of these forms of law, and have further refined his theory by identifying additional categories and subcategories of biblical and ancient Near Eastern law, but his basic formal division has remained by and large intact.35 In Benjamin DeVries's attempt at applying these concepts to rabbinic literature, specifically to the Mishnah, the same basic categories are utilized.36 David Halivni has provided an attempt at applying Alt's categories to talmudic literature as a whole.37 In Halivni's terms, however, what Alt and 34.

According to Halivni, the distinction between Alt's categories is, when applied to the Talmud, a relatively minor one. In both apodictically and casuistically formulated statements, the law is expressed tersely and categorically, and no proof or justification need be supplied. Alt's distinc- tion between apodictic and casuistic forms of law may be an important one for biblical scholars, and might even be indicative of a different source or Sitz im Leben for apodictic legal collections versus collections of casuistic law, Halivni writes, but in regard to the Talmud as a whole, "it [is] more useful to contrast the apodictic with the argumentational."38 Apodictic in this sense refers to any terse, categorically formulated statement that stands by itself, or could stand by itself, and that bears no necessary connection to any other statement in order to be understood. By the term "argumentation," Halivni refers to statements that are primarily concerned with explicating, and with providing the logical process that lies at the basis of apodictic statements. Argumentational statements cannot stand on their own, but rather depend upon other traditions in order to be intelligible. Argumentation most typically takes the form of an objec- tion or question along with a response, provided the question or objection carries some independent weight and serves to do more than evoke the response. The Talmud's argumentational character is primarily what dis- tinguishes it from an apodictic collection of laws such as the Mishnah. In the argumentational mode, conclusions are formulated as the final stage in a process of give and take. Whereas in the apodictic mode only the conclu- sions were considered worthy of preservation, in the argumentational mode the various steps leading up to the conclusion were also preserved. For my purposes, this division of talmudic literature into the two above- mentioned categories will be essential in establishing criteria by which to distinguish between the post-Rav Ashi amoraim and amoraim from earlier generations. Several modern scholars have concluded that the characteristic form of amoraic expression is the terse, categorically phrased (in Halivni's terms, apodictic) statement.39 Thus my discovery that the argumentational .'

That is, between 62 and 64 percent of their statements are argumentational, while only 13 per- cent are apodictic.

Kaplan, Redaction of the Babylonian Talmud, p. 147, noting that "word economy, brevity, and terseness are characteristic features of all Amoraic records," observed that "the peculiar form ... of all the recorded controversies between R. Aha and Rabina ... brief beyond laconicism, abrupt and obscure to the point of a riddle... is found in the records of the very first Amoraim .. ., it is employed by every Amoraic generation, and is quite as much in vogue in the period of the last Amora, Rabina bar R. Huna." Unfortunately, however, Kaplan's focus was far too narrow. He based his characterization of the entire post-Rav Ashi amoraic period on a tiny, and as it turns out unrepresentative, sampling of statements. While the apodictic form, or hora'ah, as Kaplan calls it, was still to be found even among the last amoraim, it was clearly the exception rather than the rule as far as the period as a whole is concerned. 41. We must note, however, that even though the post-Rav Ashi amoraim share the dis- tinctive stammaitic preoccupation with argumentation, the argumentation deriving from the two sources is not identical. Halivni, in the chapter on the stammaitic period in his Midrash, Mishnah, and Gemarah (Cambridge: Havard University Press, 1986), describes the stam as "plush," meaning that stammaitic argumentation is rich and overflowing. In contrast to argumentation by the post-Rav Ashi amoraim, which is almost always concise, the stammaitic variety is prolix. As a rule, argumentation by the post-Rav Ashi amoraim includes only that which is necessary for adequate comprehension. It is reminiscent of the argumentation found in midrash halakhah, where only the bare bones of an argument are preserved. Or, more accurate- ly, argumentation by the post-Rav Ashi amoraim should be placed in between midrash halakhic argumentation at one end of the scale, and stammaitic argumentation at the other end, but a good deal closer to the midrash halakhic extreme. By contrast, the stam often appears to engage in argument for argument's sake, out of sheer delight in dialogue and rhetoricity. To be specific, only about 15 percent of the argumentational statements by the post-Rav Ashi amoraim are multi-tiered, that is, go beyond the initial level of question and answer. In addition, even though there are isolated instances in which this argumentation is exceptionally long and complicated, it is most typically quite brief. Finally, once again in contrast to stammaitic argumentation, argumentation by the post-Rav Ashi amoraim is never rhetorical. The difference between the augumentation deriving from the post-Rav Ashi amoraim and that deriving from the stam seems best explicable in terms of the differing functions that their argumentation fills within the sugya. We will see later on that in their role as attributed amoraim, the post-Rav Ashi amoraim are not integrated into the most important aspects of the sugya. Their primary function is as anonymous editors, and when we encounter them as named amoraim, they appear as outsiders. They are not concerned with questions affecting the</page><page sequence="15">THE POST-RAV ASHI AMORAIM 171 In my opinion, the fact that so much argumentation was produced by the post-Rav Ashi amoraim, which contrasts so sharply with all that we know about amoraim from earlier generations,42 but which conforms well to the activity of the stam, is best explicable according to the view of David Halivni that the post-Rav Ashi amoraim composed part of the Talmud's anonymous commentary; that they were, in fact, stammaim. The proponents of the theory of saboraic redaction might explain this phenomenom by suggesting that the post-Rav Ashi amoraim merely began a trend toward argumentation that the stam continued throughout the saboraic period. Is there any necessity, they might argue, of saying that anonymous and attributed argumentational activity was carried out at the same time? The fact is, however, that no matter which theory of redaction we adopt, there was a sudden decrease in attributed amoraic activity after the death of Rav Ashi.43 If we claim that the argumentational activity of the post-Rav Ashi amoraim was merely the beginning of a trend continued by the stam throughout the saboraic period, we must posit an extremely im- probable sequence of events. We must say that talmudic activity was sud- denly and dramatically curtailed around the time of Rav Ashi's death, continued in this diminished state for close to a century, and then just as suddenly exploded once again with the beginning of the saboraic period. totality of the sugya, but with specific issues of limited scope, usually involving some detail of an opinion expressed by an earlier authority. In their role as named amoraim, the task of the post-Rav Ashi amoraim was limited to the glossing of the earlier amoraic or tannaitic core of the sugya, which task was completed when the specific problem to which they addressed them- selves had been resolved. As a result, argumentation by the post-Rav Ashi amoraim tends to be brief and single-tiered, adequate for the task these amoraim set for themselves qua amoraim. Argumentation by the stammaim, however, fills an editorial function, and is conse- quently far more extensive and complex. 42. See David Kraemer, Stylistic Characteristics of Amoraic Literature (Ann Arbor: University Microfilms International, 1985), for a statistical survey of the argumentational and apodictic material produced by amoraim prior to the post-Rav Ashi period. He found that the approximate ratio of apodictic to argumentational statements by Rav and Shmuel was 22 to 1 (p. 57), by Rav Yehuda was 3.3 to 1 (p. 64-see n. 36 there), by Rav Huna was 4 to I (p. 64), by R. Yobanan and Resh Lakish was 12 to 1 (pp 69-70, n. 45), by Rav Sheshet, Rav Hisda, Rav Nahman, Rav Yosef, Rabbah, and R. Zeira was 3.5 to 1 (pp. 80-81), by Rava and Abbaye was 3 to 2 (p. 109), by Rav Papa was 2.4 to 1 (p. 138), and by Rav Ashi was 1.4 to 1 (p. 146). At no time did he find argumentation to be the primary activity engaged in by these amoraim. There is thus a basic lack of correspondence between the activity of these earlier amoraim and the activity of the stam. 43. See n. 25 above.</page><page sequence="16">172 RICHARD KALMIN The proponents of this theory have not satisfactorily accounted for this lengthy hiatus.44 44. This hiatus has been accounted for on the basis of Persian persecutions that were directed against the Jewish communities during the post-Ray Ashi amoraic period, in the course of which rabbinical academies were closed and rabbis were put to death. During this period of disruption, the argument goes, Jewish learning was in an extremely precarious state, and it was not until the first part of the sixth century, the beginning of the saboraic period, that order was restored and Jewish learning was allowed to resume unhindered. See Weiss, Hithavvut ha-Talmud bi-Shelemuto, pp. 256-257, and Kaplan, Redaction of the Babylonian Talmud, pp. 293-299. and 315. It does appear that the rabbis suffered some sort of persecution at the hands of the Persians during this period. However, it should be noted that all of the relevant Jewish sources were composed several hundred years after the events they describe. Also, the Jewish sources are extremely laconic in their accounts of these events, making it difficult for us to gauge their exact extent and duration. And see Jacob Neusner, A History of the Jews in Babylonia, 5 (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1970): 60-72, who notes that Persian sources, also late, only preserve a record of a local persecution of limited duration. In addition, one who explains the dramatic drop in amoraic creativity during the fifth century as due to persecution cannot account for the fact that the first three decades after the death of Rav Ashi, which according to geonic accounts were free from persecution, are no less empty of amoraic activity than are the next several decades, during which the persecutions were taking place. (See Seder Tannaim ve-Amoraim, ed. Kahan, p. 6, and Iggeret Rav Sherira Gaon, ed. Lewin, pp. 94-95, according to which the persecutions did not begin until 455 c.E.). Furthermore, this explanation cannot account for the fact that these persecutions, ostensibly of such momentous impact upon rabbinic learning, left virtually no explicit traces in the Talmud itself. The one exception to the Talmud's total silence on this matter is found on Hullin 62b, where we find a reference to "the wicked Peroz," in whose reign some of the worst persecutions appear to have been carried out. See also Shabbat Ila. Saul Lieberman, in "On Persecution of the Jewish Religion," Salo Wittmayer Baron Jubilee Volume, ed. S. Lieberman and A. Hyman (Jerusalem, 1974), 3:234-235, claims that it is extremely unlikely that the Talmud would have avoided mention of an anti-Jewish persecution had such a persecution made a big impression on the rabbis. A further, even more basic difficulty with explaining this hiatus in terms of persecution is that it has by no means been demonstrated that a persecution such as would have been within the resources of an ancient (or medieval) empire to inflict would have been of sufficient intensity to serve as the impetus for a sudden and dramatic drop in creativity on the part of the victims of that persecution. This point was first suggested to me by Dr. Shaye Cohen in a course entitled "Jews and Judaism in the Ancient World," offered at the Jewish Theological Seminary in the spring of 1976. Dr. Cohen noted that there is a tendency among modern scholars to deny the role of persecution in shaping the extent and nature of literary creativity. For example (the following examples are the responsibility of the present writer, and not of Dr. Cohen), a figure such as the Rambam, who composed one of his classic works, the Perush ha-Mishnah, in the midst of persecution, is incomprehensible according to this explanation. To take a more modern example, Yehuda Bauer, in A History of the Holocaust (New York: Franklin Watts, 1982), p. 179, writes that "following the Nazi entry into Poland, and later the USSR, education in the Jewish Ghettos was forbidden. Newspapers were not permitted and libraries were closed." Even under these circumstances, however, "writers continued to write, and painters to</page><page sequence="17">THE POST-RAV ASHI AMORAIM 173 According to the theory of stammaitic redaction, however, the tremen- dous creativity of the amoraic period gave way to the tremendous creativity of the stammaitic period, with named amoraic activity comprising only a fraction of what was produced during this time. No unaccounted-for hiatus is implied by this latter theory. My research has also uncovered a second feature which distinguishes the post-Ray Ashi amoraim from all previous generations of amoraim, and suggests their identity as stammaim. I have found that all of the argumenta- tion by the post-Rav Ashi amoraim, consisting of almost 300 statements, was carried out in the presence of a tiny group of authorities who act in all significant respects as typical amoraim.45 According to the theories of con- tinuous and saboraic redaction, it is unclear why the post-Rav Ashi amoraim should be totally unwilling to ask questions, or to make objections and responses, in the presence of other atypical late amoraim, or in the presence of no other amoraim at all. By contrast, this peculiar pattern seems perfectly explicable, in fact seems necessary, according to the theory that the post-Rav Ashi amoraim were stammaim. If these late amoraim appeared in both the attributional and anonymous modes, we would expect some fixed principle to determine when they were mentioned in the Talmud by name and when they remained anonymous. The present phenomenon pro- vides us with the key to identifying this fixed principle. It appears that when the post-Rav Ashi amoraim engaged in argumentation in the presence of no paint, and scientists continued their research. The few archives that survive supply ample evidence of a feverish intellectual activity during the ghetto period." In general, in explaining the formation of the Talmud, or any other rabbinic work, it seems preferable to search first for explanations that arise out of the internal logic of the work itself, rather than for explanations that originate outside the text. It appears that the explanation of the phenomenon before us in terms of persecution is nothing more than one further working out of the "lachrymose conception of Jewish history" on the part of nineteenth- and early- twentieth-century scholars, decried by Salo Baron in, "New Horizons in Jewish History," Freedom and Reason: Studies in Philosophy and Jewish Culture in Memory of Morris Raphael Cohen, ed. S. W. Baron, E. Nagel, and K. S. Pinson (Glencoe, Ill., 1951), pp. 340-344. See Jeremy Cohen, "Roman Imperial Policy Toward the Jews from Constantine Until the End of the Palestinian Patriarchate (ca. 429)," Byzantine Studies 3 (1976): 1-29, who provides a con- vincing refutation of the attempt on the part of several Jewish historians to account for the redaction of the Palestinian Talmud in terms of Roman persecution. My thanks to Dr. Shaye Cohen for drawing my attention to this article. 45. See above, n. 22, where I discuss briefly the fact that there were a small number of post-Rav Ashi amoraim who share several characteristics in common with earlier, classical amoraim. I concluded there that these few amoraim cannot be considered representative of the post-Rav Ashi amoraic period in general. See also below.</page><page sequence="18">174 RICHARD KALMIN other amora, or in the presence of another atypical late amora, their argu- mentation was formulated anonymously, as part of the stam. However, when they engaged in argumentation in the presence of full-fledged amoraim, their names were transmitted along with their statements, in con- formity with the amora they came in contact with. It was thus the presence or absence of typical amoraim that determined whether argumentation by the post-Rav Ashi amoraim would be attributed or anonymous. When the post-Rav Ashi amoraim made apodictic statements, however, they were routinely mentioned by name even though no typical amora was present. Thus the character of their statements was also important in deter- mining whether they would be attributed or anonymous. When the post- Rav Ashi amoraim made apodictic statements, a quintessentially amoraic activity, they consistently appeared from behind their veil of anonymity and were mentioned in the Talmud by name.46 We find, therefore, that the attributed statements by the post-Rav Ashi amoraim conform to certain peculiar patterns that make it difficult to accept these statements as the total extent of what these amoraim contri- buted to the Talmud. Along the same lines, we find that approximately 79 percent of the entire body of activity by the post-Rayv Ashi amoraim was carried out the presence of just two sages: Rav Ashi and the later Ravina. 46. It might be objected that while it is true that apodictic statements are extremely rare in the anonymous parts of the Talmud, they are nevertheless occasionally found. What deter- mines, therefore, when an apodictic statement was formulated anonymously, and when it was attributed to a particular authority? We can answer this question by pointing out that there was certainly more than one school of stammaim. Some stammaim thought that under no circum- stances should they be mentioned in the Talmud by name. Therefore, even their apodictic state- ments were recorded anonymously. Other stammaim were not so extreme, and thought that their names should be mentioned under certain well-defined circumstances. To the former group no doubt belong the heads of academies who are mentioned by Rav Sherira (Iggeret Rav Sherira Gaon, ed. Lewin, pp. 94-97; see also Shalom Albeck, "Sof ha-Hora'ah va-AIlaronei ha-Amoraim," Sinai, Sefer Yovel [Jerusalem: Mosad ha-Rav Kook, 1958], pp. 68-73) as having lived after the death of Rav Ashi and yet are never mentioned in the Talmud by name. It should also be emphasized that the picture I have presented of a variety of stammaitic schools is a great deal more than mere speculation. Modern critical scholarship has revealed that the anonymous sections of the Talmud are by no means monolithic (see, for example, Weiss, Hithavvut ha-Talmud bi-Shelemuto, pp. 254 ff., who concludes that the Talmud did not undergo uniform redaction). We find numerous contradictions between various stammaitic passages which are indicative of opposing schools of thought. See Kalmin, Post-Rav Ashi Amoraim, for my treatment of Bava Me;ia 46b-47a (pp. 394-395), Hullin O1a-b (pp. 459-463), and Niddah 67b-68a (pp. 512-514). See also Halivni, Mekorot u-Mesorot on Eruvin 37a, p. 109, n. 6, and the references cited there. It would be a simple matter to multiply examples.</page><page sequence="19">THE POST-RAV ASHI AMORAIM 175 Such extreme dependence upon such a small number of sages is completely without precedent in the earlier amoraic period. The question arises as to how the post-Ray Ashi amoraim occupied themselves when not in the presence of these two sages. In addition, we find that objections and questions-make up all but a handful of the argumentational statements by the post-Ray Ashi amoraim. For typical amoraim, the proportion of objections and questions on the one hand, and resolutions and responses on the other, is approximately equal. This is roughly equivalent to saying that we encounter typical amoraim as both students and teachers. The stam as well contains vast numbers of responses, certainly no more infrequently than it contains objections and questions. Amoraim from the post-Ray Ashi period, by contrast, appear to have been students who never went on to become teachers. The extremely dependent and one-dimensional character of these late amoraim indicates that something is missing in the picture we form of their activity if we con- fine ourselves to their attributed statements. Once again, according to the theory of saboraic redaction we are confronted with a perplexing hiatus between two periods of enormous creativity and independence. It appears that this anomaly is best explained by postulating that the attributed state- ments by the post-Ray Ashi amoraim do not represent the sum total of what they contributed to the Talmud. A great deal more, after the death of Ray Ashi, entered the Talmud anonymously. My research has uncovered additional respects in which the post-Ray Ashi amoraim exhibit distinctive characteristics.47 Due to considerations of space, I will confine myself to an outline of the most important of these characteristics. We find that attributional statements by post-Ray Ashi amoraim, in contrast to statements by amoraim in general, almost never form an integral part of the sugya's main concern. They are almost never found as one in a series of amoraic statements. They are almost never one of several attempts at answering the same question, resolving the same objection, stating an original halakhic opinion on a particular issue, and so on. Rather, statements by post-Ray Ashi amoraim typically have the character of glosses on an earlier amoraic or tannaitic core. This characteristic also seems best explicable according to the theory 47. For example, see Kalmin, Post-Rav Ashi Amoraim, pp. 110-119, where I discuss the absence of quotations by later post-Rav Ashi amoraim of earlier post-Rav Ashi amoraim.</page><page sequence="20">176 RICHARD KALMIN that the post-Ray Ashi amoraim are in reality stammaim. In their attribu- tional statements, the post-Ray Ashi amoraim appear to have made a conscious attempt at keeping themselves distinct from amoraim in general. They were aware that as stammaim, creators and preservers of argumenta- tion, their role in the sugya was profoundly different from that of the amoraim. They seem to have viewed their contribution as peripheral to the amoraic core of the sugya, and they therefore avoided fully integrating themselves into that amoraic core. It is interesting to note that the anonymous sections of the Talmud exhibit this same nonintegrative character. By this I mean that the anony- mity of the stammaim preserves the distinction between the stam and the amoraim. It serves to maintain the amoraic statements as the core of the sugya, relegating the comments of the stam to the periphery. Thus the nonintegrative character of both the post-Ray Ashi amoraim and the stammaim establishes an additional link between them. In addition, the fact that attributional statements by the post-Ray Ashi amoraim almost never form part of the sugya's main concern can be explained according to the consideration that as stammaim, the major por- tion of their energy was invested in the anonymous creation of argumenta- tion When we encounter them in their guise as named amoraim, we are not observing them in their natural habitat, as it were. Their attributional state- ments are atypical of their activity as a whole. It is therefore not at all sur- prising that they should appear in their present contexts as outsiders, as not fully integrated into the sugya. In my discussion prior to this point, I have examined ways in which the post-Ray Ashi amoraim act in a manner atypical of any previous amoraic generation, and how this atypical activity suggests their identity as stam- maim, as participants in the the anonymous editing of the Talmud. In the following pages I will analyze the stam commentary on statements by the post-Ray Ashi amoraim and evaluate whether this commentary supports Halivni's further contention that stammaitic activity came to a halt at the end of the amoraic period, or suggests instead that this activity continued throughout the saboraic period. That is, I will evaluate whether Halivni's theory should be accepted in its entirety, or whether a slightly new theory should be formulated, one which posits stammaitic activity throughout both the post-Ray Ashi amoraic and saboraic periods (see Table 2). Julius Kaplan was the first to investigate the stam based on a post-Ray Ashi amora (the later Ravina) with a view toward evaluating the role of that</page><page sequence="21">THE POST-RAV ASHI AMORAIM 177 amora in the redaction of the Talmud.48 He cited one case in which Ravina is quoted by the stam, and one case in which there are two opposing stam interpretations of a term utilized by Ravina. Kaplan argued that Ravina could not have been the editor in either context, and that the final editing of the Talmud must therefore be pushed even beyond the time of Ravina and into the saboraic period.49 However, Kaplan's proofs clearly do not bear the weight of his thesis. One or even several cases in which Ravina is quoted by the stam hardly establish Kaplan's contention that the anonymous editing of the Talmud was the work of the saboraim. In the first place, it is possible that the saboraic period did not begin until around the year 520 c.E., with the death of Rav Yose (see above and n. 18), in which case there is no reason why a stam based on the later Ravina, who died about twenty years earlier, is necessarily saboraic.50 In the second place, even if we accept Ravina's death as marking the beginning of the saboraic period, must a stam quotation of Ravina, or other comparable forms of stam commentary based on this amora, necessarily derive from the saboraic period?5' Benjamin Lewin 48. Kaplan, Redaction of the Babylonian Talmud, pp. 143-147. 49. Kaplan adduces other proofs for his thesis that the final editing of the Talmud was saboraic. See our discussion of these proofs in note 54 below. 50. In defense of Kaplan, it must be noted that, in common with nearly all modern scholars, he places the beginning of the saboraic period after the death of Ravina b. d'Rav Huna in 501 c.E. Halivni likewise originally held this view (see Mekorot u-Mesorot, introduction to Yoma-ilagigah, p. 7) and only recently revised his opinion. See n. I to his chapter on the stammaim in Midrash, Mishnah, and Gemara. 51. According to Solomon Rapoport, in Kerem Uemed, ed. Samuel Goldenberg (Prague: Landau, 1841), p. 250, all of the stam based on statements by "later" amoraim derives from the saboraic period. Rapoport cited Gittin 60a, where we find an anonymous rejection of a state- ment by Mar bar Rav Ashi, who died according to geonic accounts in the year 468 c.E., approximately half a century before the beginning of the saboraic period (see Friedman, "Al Derekh Heker ha-Sugya," pp. 10-11, n. 14). Several scholars have taken issue with Rapoport's claim, arguing that in the case he cites, the stam might derive from an anonymous authority who postdated Mar bar Rav Ashi, but who lived prior to the saboraic period. (See, for example, Halevy, Dorot ha-Rishonim, 3:137-138. His argument is repeated by Yebiel Weinberg, Mebkarim be-Talmud [Berlin: Jewish Theological Seminary of Berlin, 1937-38], p. v. However, Weinberg claims that the case cited by Rapoport can be shown on the basis of stylistic considerations to be a saboraic addition. Compare Halivni, Mekorot u-Mesorot, introduction to Yoma-Hagigah, p. 10.) In the opinion of the present writer, the same argument can be directed against the view that stam material based on statements by Ravina b. d'Rav Huna must be saboraic. See our dis- cussion below.</page><page sequence="22">178 RICHARD KALMIN appears to have answered this question in the affirmative.52 He points out isolated examples of anonymous commentary based on statements by the latest amoraim, which in his opinion were therefore saboraic. Halivni car- ries this argument further, claiming that all of the anonymous material based on the later Ravina, as well as that based on Ravina's contemporaries in the final amoraic generation, had its origin in the saboraic period.53 However, it is the opinion of the present writer that the stam commen- tary on even the latest amora does not necessarily date from the saboraic period. It is quite conceivable that Ravina could have made a statement several decades before his death, and that a stam living somewhat later, but prior to the saboraic period, could have commented upon his statement, utilized his statement in an argument, and even interpolated into his state- ment. It is when additions by the stam reveal misunderstandings about the sources on which they are based that we must posit a significant passage of time between commentator and source, and that such a commentary based on a post-Rav Ashi amora should very likely be assigned to the saboraic period.54 However, examination of the stam based on the post-Rav Ashi amoraim reveals that such misunderstandings are not frequent. We find that the number of cases in which the stam offers forced interpretations of state- ments by post-Rav Ashi amoraim is extremely small. We find that the stam is virtually never uncertain as to the correct meaning of a statement by a 52. B. Lewin, Rabbanan Saborai ve-Talmudam, pp. 15-16, quoting Meshulam Behr, Divre Meshulam (Frankfurt am Main: D. Draller, 1925-26). 53. Halivni, Mekorot u-Mesorot, introduction to Yoma-Hagigah, p. 10, and on Sukkah 18a, pp. 182 ff. 54. Kaplan, Redaction of the Babylonian Talmud, pp. 143-146, also records a few cases in which the attribution of a statement to the later Ravina is uncertain, and a few other cases in which Ravina's statements were taught in alternative versions. Kaplan argues that Ravina could not have been the editor in these instances, which provides further proof for his thesis that the final editing of the Talmud was carried out by the saboraim. However, are the handful of cases cited by Kaplan sufficient to prove his point? Many instances in which there are two traditions regarding the author of a statement, or regarding the actual content of a statement, are traceable to transmissional difficulties that arose during the post-talmudic period (see, for example, Mekorot u-Mesorot on Yoma-Hagigah, p. 101, and p. 389, n. 3). That is, the few cases in which the later Ravina's statement has come down to us in more than one version might involve nothing more than post-talmudic errors in transmission. The same holds true for the other amoraim who lived during the post-Rav Ashi period. That is, the few cases in which the author or the content of a statement by a post-Rav Ashi amora was transmitted in more than one version (I counted six or seven such cases) might be traceable to post-talmudic errors in transmission.</page><page sequence="23">THE POST-RAV ASHI AMORAIM 179 post-Ray Ashi amora. We likewise find that it is rare for the stam and the post-Ray Ashi amoraim to be working with opposing versions of the same source. For example, when we can determine which version of a baraita a post-Ray Ashi amora based himself on, it is rare to find the stam based upon an opposing version of the same baraita. The stam and the post-Ray Ashi amoraim thus had before them the same basic corpus of material. We also find that it is rare for the stam not to have received the full text of a statement by a post-Ray Ashi amora, or not to have received the response by a post-Rav Ashi amora to a question or objection, or not to have received the original context of a statement by a post-Rav Ashi amora. To be specific, my investigation revealed that the stam exhibits signs of chrono- logical distance in its commentary in only 6 to 8 percent of the total number of statements by post-Ray Ashi amoraim. One might argue that we should have found more evidence of chronolo- gical distance separating the stam from the post-Rav Ashi amoraim accord- ing to the theory that the stam continued throughout the saboraic period, which many scholars claim lasted almost two hundred years. However, it is possible to make the opposite argument as well, namely, that we found too much evidence of chronological distance according to the theory that the stam did not continue beyond the amoraic period. Why are there, the argument might go, so many instances of discontinuity between the stam and the post-Ray Ashi amoraim if the two are completely contempora- neous? The fact is that at present we lack the criteria necessary for calcu- lating in any precise mathematical way how chronological distance between redactor and source determines the level of discontinuity between them. We cannot say with any degree of reliability, for example, how much evidence of chronological distance we would expect to find in a stam separated by 10, 50, or 150 years from its sources. Such mathematical precision, if it is attainable at all, will have to wait until we have statistics for the stam based on every amoraic generation. We also find that the stam commentary on statements by post-Rav Ashi amoraim, when it exists at all, is for the most part extremely thin. We never find the stam making statements by post-Rav Ashi amoraim the basis for sugyot of any degree of complexity. Most typically, the stam will consist of no more than a simple objection and response, a brief interpolation, a halakhic decision,55 and the like. 55. Many of these halakhic decisions, even in the absence of explicit proof, can be assumed to be post-talmudic additions to the text. Lewin, Rabbanan Saborai ve-Talmudam, pp. 46 ff,.</page><page sequence="24">180 RICHARD KALMIN More specifically, we find that between 27 and 30 percent of the total number of statements by the post-Ray Ashi amoraim have extremely brief layers of stam commentary based on them, only 7 percent have extensive layers of stam commentary based on them, and the remaining 63 to 66 percent have no stam commentary at all.56 At first glance, the existence of such a thin layer of stam seems extremely difficult for the view that stammaitic activity continued throughout the saboraic period. If the bulk of the stam were removed from the final amoraim by a generation or more, then why should there be any significant difference between the volume of stam commentary based on these amoraim and that based on earlier generations? We do not find, for example, that an amora such as Rav Papa refers to statements by his immediate predecessors, Abbaye and Rava, any less frequently than he refers to statements by earlier amoraim. However, the proponents of this view could account for this thin layer of stam by pointing out that the saboraim, as editors, were primarily con- cerned with raising and resolving difficulties, filling in lacunae, and the like, in the amoraic and tannaitic material that had been transmitted to them. Since the saboraic editors were relatively near in time to the post-Rav Ashi amoraim, and they therefore received the statements by these amoraim basically intact, there was little that required their editorial concern. The material they received from these generations did not demand much in the way of editorial revision. In addition, the proponents of this theory could argue that since the post-Rav Ashi amoraim tended to consign themselves to the periphery of the sugya, with their statements exhibiting the character of glosses on an earlier amoraic or tannaitic core, the stam tended to avoid them, concen- trating instead on the major issues raised in the sugya. points out how frequently such halakhic pronouncements are additions to the sugya based on decisions by the geonim. This is not to suggest, however, that all such halakhic pronounce- ments are post-talmudic additions. Compare Frankel, "Beitrige zu einer Einleitung in den Talmud," p. 269. 56. Stam commentary consisting of three distinct statements of normal length, or four extremely brief statements, has been considered brief. Stam commentary consisting of more than three distinct statements of normal length, or more than four extremely brief statements has been considered extensive. This cut-off point is admittedly somewhat arbitrary, but any point at which we impose such a boundary will inevitably be arbitrary. We have therefore attempted to set the boundary at a point at which all would agree that everything we identified as brief was in fact brief. In doing so, it is quite likely that we have set the boundary too low, and that some portion of what we have characterized as extensive stam should in actuality be described as brief.</page><page sequence="25">THE POST-RAV ASHI AMORAIM 181 Support for the claim that the post-Ray Ashi amoraim, due to their peripheral character, suffered editorial neglect at the hands of the saboraim, appears to be found in the fact that with certain rare exceptions, technical terminology does not introduce statements by these amoraim.57 This nearly total absence of technical terminology, that is, of terminology which does not form part of an amora's actual statement, but which serves to indicate what role the statement fills within the sugya, sets the post-Rav Ashi amoraim apart from all earlier generations of amoraim. There is substantial evidence that this terminology, clearly editorial in character, was added to the Talmud by the saboraim, which means that we have explicit proof that the saboraim, in their capacity as editors, ignored the activity of their immediate predecessors in the amoraic period.58 The proponents of the theory of continuous redaction could likewise account for the thin layer of stam based on the post-Rav Ashi amoraim. They could point out that talmudic activity had for the most part ceased during this later period. We have already noted that comparatively little was said by the named amoraim who lived after Ray Ashi, so it should not surprise us that very little stam was produced during an even later period. This latest phenomenon is also easily explicable according to the theory of stammaitic redaction. In addition to utilizing the arguments employed above on behalf of those who claim that redaction continued throughout the saboraic period, Halivni could argue that it is to be expected that the stam would base its commentary more on amoraic material from earlier genera- tions than on the amoraic material that was being produced during the stammaitic period itself. He could argue that this tendency on the part of the stammaim, the editors of the Talmud, corresponds to the tendency exhibited 57. The term nnn, a transmissional term (i.e., a term which introduces quotations of earlier statements or sugyot), is found introducing statements by post-Rav Ashi amoraim. (I have at present no explanation for why this term should be consistently exceptional in this regard.) Also, very rarely we find technical terms introducing statements by post-Ray Ashi amoraim made during the lifetime of Rav Ashi. 58. Brfill, "Entstehungsgeschichte der babylonischen Talmuds," pp. 67-68, was the first to attribute certain technical terms to the saboraim. Kaplan, Redaction of the Babylonian Talmud, p. 13, pointed out that the absence of some of these terms in the Yerushalmi no doubt suggested this conclusion to Brfill. Halivni in his Midrash, Mishnah, and Gemara, chap. 6, goes further, crediting the saboraim with the introduction of all of the technical terminology into the Talmud. Halivni was anticipated by Hyman Klein, who in "Gemara and Sebara," pp. 85 ff., and p. 91, argues that technical terms belong to the sebaric interpretation and not to the original text. In his later work, Klein explicitly identifies the saboraim as the authors of sebara. See also the present writer's treatment of Bava Me;ia 80b-81a and Avodah Zarah 22a in The Post-Rav Ashi Amoraim, pp. 400-404 and 433.</page><page sequence="26">182 RICHARD KALMIN by the editor of another ancient rabbinic source: the Mishnah. It is univer- sally acknowledged that Rabbi Judah the Prince's editorial activity con- sisted at least in part of compilation, of determining which sources should be included in the Mishnah, and which should be excluded. As I noted above, we find that hardly a trace of Rabbi's entire generation has been preserved in this document. That is to say, Rabbi systematically excluded his own generation when he compiled the Mishnah. Rabbi, the editor of the Mishnah, is comparable to the stammaim, the editors of the Talmud. A crucial part of the editorial activity of the stammaim, according to Halivni, consisted of the elucidation and explication of amoraic material. Here as well, the editors for all intents and purposes ignored the activity of their own contemporaries, commenting on statements by post-Ray Ashi amoraim only briefly and intermittently. It is interesting to speculate that perhaps in general, editors of ancient documents tended not to concern themselves with the activity of their own contemporaries. Our analysis of the stam commentary on statements by the post-Rav Ashi amoraim, therefore, has not enabled us to decide whether the theory of stammaitic redaction should be accepted in its entirety, or whether this theory and the theory of saboraic redaction are both partially correct. That is, we are not yet in a position to determine whether stammaitic activity ceased with the death of the last amora, or whether it continued throughout the saboraic period. Throughout this paper, I have spoken of the post-Ray Ashi amoraic period as if it was by and large monolithic, as if there existed no significant differences between the individual authorities who lived during this time. Before concluding, however, I must make note of the fact that a small number of post-Rav Ashi amoraim did not share several of the characteris- tics exhibited by the overwhelming majority of their contemporaries. Rather, they acted in varying degrees as typical amoraim. This fact should not surprise us, however. On the contrary, it would be odd if we did not find a small group of sages who even after the death of Ray Ashi carried on the old amoraic ways, since it is not the rule for long-established patterns of behavior and modes of expression to vanish overnight without a trace. Typically, such patterns linger on for a while in a more or less diminished state before they give way at last to newer forms. It will prove illuminating to examine Mar bar Ray Ashi, perhaps the most prominent of these typically amoraic post-Rav Ashi amoraim, in somewhat greater detail. Mar bar Rav Ashi's character as a typical amora,</page><page sequence="27">THE POST-RAV ASHI AMORAIM 183 rather than presenting a difficulty for the thesis that the Talmud was edited during the post-Ray Ashi amoraic period, provides us instead with an addi- tional argument against the traditional view that Ray Ashi edited the Talmud. If Ray Ashi was an amora like any other amora, then it makes good sense that Mar bar Ray Ashi should follow the pattern adhered to by his father and likewise act as a typical amora, even if it meant placing him- self in opposition to the rest of his generation. However, if Rav Ashi edited the Talmud, and therefore concluded, or attempted to conclude, the amoraic period, then why would his son reopen this period by reverting back to the traditional amoraic ways, as if in total refutation of his father's life work? Mar bar Rav Ashi, typical though he is, exhibits one extremely peculiar characteristic, a characteristic that sets him apart not only from earlier amoraim, but also from all of his contemporaries. Mar bar Ray Ashi, parti- cularly later on in his career, almost never comes into contact with other amoraim for any purpose whatoever. It is quite possible that Mar bar Ray Ashi's nearly total isolation derived in part from a basic inability to get along with other people. However, something besides simple personality conflict seems to be at issue between him and the rest of his generation. Mar bar Rav Ashi seems to have been obstinately opposed to the new stammaitic trends. He and his father pre- ferred the apodictic to the argumentational mode to almost exactly the same degree.59 But what was standard behavior in Ray Ashi's time had by the time of his son come to be perceived as presumptuousness and arrogance. The reason is that the stammaim were of the opinion that amoraic activity in the traditional sense was no longer possible after the death of Ray Ashi. Even Rav Ashi came into regular contact with sages who exhibited marked stammaitic tendencies. Evidently in Rav Ashi's time, amoraic methods were still dominant, and the different preoccupations of the stammaim and the amoraim had not yet widened into full-scale conflict. By the time of Mar bar Rav Ashi, however, the amoraim were clearly in the minority, and it was the stammaitic methods that had gained the ascen- dancy. The continuation of the old amoraic ways could no longer be taken for granted, but rather had to be fought for.60 59. Mar bar Rav Ashi's ratio of apodictic to argumentational statements is between 1.1 and 1.2 to 1. See Kraemer, Stylistic Characteristics of Amoraic Literature, p. 146, who concludes that Rav Ashi's ratio of apodictic to argumentational statements was approximately 1.4 to 1. 60. It is certainly no coincidence that of the two cases in which Mar bar Rav Ashi comes into contact with atypical amoraim, one takes place while he is still a student (Berakhot 45b),</page><page sequence="28">184 RICHARD KALMIN It is perhaps on this basis that we can explain the puzzling fact that Mar bar Rav Ashi, who was the logical successor to his father as head of the academy, was not chosen for that position until long after his father's death. And even then, he had to resort to trickery in order to overcome an attempt at appointing another sage to that office.61 The opposition to Mar bar Rav Ashi was due to his contemporaries' perception of him as stubbornly un- responsive to the concerns of a new age. Mar bar Rav Ashi's stature as heir to Rav Ashi, his direct link to the amoraic period, was sufficient to over- come that opposition, and he won the appointment. But his influence no doubt remained marginal, even in his capacity as head of the academy. The Talmud bears eloquent testimony to Mar bar Rav Ashi's inability to achieve any long-lasting victory over his stammaitic foes. To reiterate, we found that statements by the great majority of post-Rav Ashi amoraim exhibit several features linking them with the stam, the anonymous editorial layer of the Talmud, and setting them apart from all previous generations of amoraim. We found, for example, that in com- formity with the stam, and unlike amoraim in general, argumentational statements by the great majority of post-Rav Ashi amoraim overwhelm- ingly outnumber their apodictic statements. We also found that statements by these late amoraim tend to have the character of glosses on an earlier amoraic core. The nonintegrative character of their statements established an additional link between the post-Rav Ashi amoraim and the stam, since the stam, by virtue of its anonymity, exhibits this same nonintegrative character. These and other commonalities allowed us to conclude that the great majority of post-Rav Ashi amoraim are stammaim. That is, while the major bulk of the stam was produced by sages whose names have not sur- vived anywhere within the Talmud itself, the great majority of post-Rav Ashi amoraim functioned in a dual capacity as both stammaim and amoraim. Having established the approximate date for the beginning of stam- maitic activity, we turned to the question of the date for the conclusion of this activity. Was the stam by and large completed by the end of the amoraic period in 501 or 520 C.E., or did composition of the stam continue beyond that date into the saboraic period? According to the first alternative, before tensions had fully developed, and the other (Hullin 97b) also involves the later Ravina, who, like Mar bar Rav Ashi, acted for the most part as a typical amora. 61. Bava Batra 12b.</page><page sequence="29">THE POST-RAV ASHI AMORAIM 185 the saboraim contributed to the redaction of the Talmud in relatively minor ways, for example by means of the addition of technical terms indicating the role that a statement fills within a sugya, and the arrangement of completed sugyot in their present contexts.62 According to the second alternative, the saboraim continued the composition of stammaitic commentary; they con- tinued to analyze, explicate, emend, and complete the tannaitic and amoraic strata of the sugya, such that the saboraic period is a new and distinct era only due to the fact that amoraic activity had finally come to a complete and irrevocable end. We analyzed the stam commentary on the statements by the post-Rav Ashi amoraim in an effort to determine whether or not signs of chronolo- gical distance between them can be discerned. Our reasoning was that if such signs were frequent, we would be confronted with a compelling argu- ment on behalf of the theory that composition of the stam continued well into the saboraic period. Conversely, if such signs were virtually nonexis- tent, we would be justified in deciding in favor of the theory which views stammaitic activity as having ended, for the most part, by the beginning of the saboraic period. We pointed out that only rarely does the layer of stam based on the post-Rav Ashi amoraim exhibit indications of chronological distance separating commentator from source. However, we concluded that at present we lack the criteria necessary for determining the significance of these figures, of determining whether this level of chronological distance precludes, or points toward, a late date for the conclusion of stammaitic activity. Full resolution of this question must wait until the stam commen- tary on every amoraic generation has been systematically and critically analyzed. Jewish Theological Seminary New York, N.Y. 62. Such editorial activity is minor in comparison with the editorial activity of the stam. It is undeniable that the addition of a term indicating the role that a particular statement fills within a sugya can have a significant effect on our understanding of the sugya. The words of a sage that might admit of interpretation as a declarative statement will, upon addition of the appropriate technical term, be interpreted as an objection. This will in turn affect our inter- pretation of the statement that follows, which must now be understood as a response to the objection, and so on until the conclusion of the sugya. Nevertheless, such superficial editorial additions are much less likely to fundamentally alter our understanding of the sugya than are additions by the stam, in which the interpretation of a statement, or of the sugya as a whole, is routinely affected by the addition by the stam.</page><page sequence="30">186 RICHARD KALMIN Table 1 Characteristics of Talmudic Rabbis* Classical Amoraim (flourished prior to the death of Ray Ashi in 427 C.E.) 1.
