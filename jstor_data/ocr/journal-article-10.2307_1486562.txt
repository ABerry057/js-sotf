<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bette Roth Young. Emma Lazarus in Her World: Life and Letters. Philadel- phia: Jewish Publication Society, 1995. xxi, 298 pp. There was a time when almost every American schoolchild knew that the poem engraved on a bronze plaque inside the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty, welcoming the world's "huddled masses yearning to breathe free," was the work of Emma Lazarus. But probably very few of those children, or their parents, were aware of the fact that Lazarus was the most distinguished Jewish-American writer of the nineteenth century-a highly cultured and distinctly gifted woman who, though she lived only to the age of thirty-eight, produced a significant body of writing, much of it on Jewish subjects. In the last years of her life (she died in 1887), Lazarus became a committed</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 275 proto-Zionist, eagerly learning Hebrew and publishing passionate defenses of Eastern European Jewry. But that is only part of the story. The other part, to which the bulk of this very traditional "Life and Letters" volume is devoted, concerns the epistolary friendships Lazarus established with leading figures in New York arts and letters during the last decade of her life--and especially with Helena deKay Gilder, the wife of Richard Watson Gilder, celebrated editor of Century magazine during its glory years in the 1880s. There are also letters from Lazarus to Rose Hawthorne Lathrop (daughter of Nathaniel and Sophia), charming notes from Henry James to Lazarus, and a handful of others (e.g., EL to E. R. A. Seligman, later a highly respected economist, on the "Jewish Question"). But the centerpiece of this volume comprises Lazarus's letters to Helena Gilder. Though they are not outstanding examples of the genre of familiar letters, they are certainly engaging: lively, effusive, chock-full of intelligent and sometimes amusing observations on books, music, paintings, European travel, and the like. As Lazarus remarks to Gilder in 1886, "I take refuge from the cruelties &amp; trivialities of life, in art, nature &amp; books." So, modo Victoriano, the letters are largely high-minded and impersonal-a sharing of mutual cultural interests between two well-bred young women of the better (upper?) class. My point is that in the Lazarus-Gilder correspondence, Emma Lazarus for the most part positions herself as in no essential way different from her Wasp friend. (Interestingly, in letters to Thomas Wren Ward and Rose Lathrop, Lazarus refers to herself and her friends collectively as "us clumsy lumbering Saxons" and calls England "that dear Mother-soil.") To be sure, she makes no attempt to hide her Jewishness: she tells Gilder how touched she was when Robert Browning "gave me his photograph, &amp; wrote under it an affectionate inscription in Hebrew," and reports "that my own people--the Jews" received her "with open arms" in London; and that as a "stiff-necked ... heretic" at Salisbury Cathedral she "nearly died laughing" when she discovered the Athanasian Creed. But these allusions to being Jewish are offered as brief, and perhaps quaint, asides--merely curious blips in the larger and more familiarly shared flow of social and tourist observations. Her posture toward her Christian friends seems to suggest that being Jewish, like having a limp or a stutter or red hair, is an incidental characteristic that in no way defines the basic nature of her cultural affiliations. At heart the values they share are the important ones. In making this point I do not intend at all to fault Lazarus but rather to describe the awkward balance that she, along with many other assimilated</page><page sequence="3">276 BOOK REVIEWS Western Jews, was forced to maintain. The two parts of her life-being Jewish, on the one hand, being well-bred and "cultured," on the other--did not quite seem to fit together, as if the one were the denial or obverse of the other. (I am reminded of W. E. B. Dubois's theory about the burden of "double-consciousness" that had to be bome by American blacks.) It is clear that Lazarus was in no way ashamed to be publicly identified as a Jew (the volume of poems she published in 1882 was boldly entitled Songs of a Semite). She was, however, increasingly challenged to maintain her cultural balance as the "Jewish Question" became more pressing. In an introductory chapter entitled "A Jewish Polemic," Bette Roth Young makes a valiant attempt to come to grips with the ambivalences and contradictions that fill Lazarus's writings on Jewish issues in the 1880s. Roth views Emma Lazarus as an "uptown Jew" with an "aristocratic cast of mind" who stood "with her people" in her poetry but "above them" in her prose. In particular, Roth takes Lazarus to task for an 1882 essay on Disraeli entitled "Was the Earl of Beaconsfield a Representative Jew?" Pointing out that Disraeli, like Lazarus herself, was both Sephardic and "a Jew in Christian society," Roth observes that Lazarus "probably identified with Disraeli," but then drops her own insight and goes on to excoriate Lazarus for falling into the trap of trying to explain, and excuse, Disraeli's faults as being simply the reflex of his "racial" inheritance. "At the risk of tarnishing her halo," Roth concludes, "we must point out that today Emma Lazarus would be known as a racist. Her stereotypical concept of the Jewish 'race' is almost as offensive as that of those European anti-Semites she held in such great disdain" (p. 55). I think Roth would have been well-advised to stick with an analysis of Emma Lazarus's Disraeli piece that views it as the expression of her own painfully conflicted feelings about being a modem assimilated Western Jew. Calling Emma Lazarus a racist seems to me both wildly unfair and vengefully presentist, because Roth nowhere acknowledges that racialism (which I believe is the correct term) was a familiar part of the intellectual baggage of Lazarus's time. In particular, Emma Lazarus was undoubtedly echoing the writings of two of her favorite thinkers, Matthew Arnold and Ralph Waldo Emerson. Both of them--Amold in his celebrated distinction between Hellenism and Hebraism, and in his work on Celtic literature; Emerson in his English Traits (and we might throw in Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom 's Cabin for good measure)-followed the penchant of their age for distinguishing among what we call ethnic groups according to their "racial" characteristics. Though we may now view this habit as</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 277 dangerous pseudo-science or pseudo-anthropology, it was as widespread as theories of body-types in the 1940s and 1950s (endomorphs, mesomorphs, ectomorphs). Racialism, the theory that individual ethnic groups have defin- able characteristics, unquestionably has a tendency to blend into racism, the theory that races are not only different but also superior and inferior; but that was not necessarily the case in the nineteenth century. In employing the analytical tools supplied by contemporary racial theories, Lazarus may very well have been misguided; but it seems to me bizarre to call her a racist and align her position with that of late-nineteenth-century (and by extension, twentieth-century) antisemites. It is probably also worth adding that Lazarus's interest in viewing Disraeli as a "representative" Jew is deeply indebted to her beloved Emerson in another way, since in his Representative Men (1850) he had elaborated on a theory of cultural representativeness that he then applied to his critical descriptions of such figures as Shakespeare, Montaigne, Napoleon, and Goethe. Lazarus, it seems to me, was trying her hand at an analogous exercise in her essay on Disraeli. In her case, however, the Emersonian stance of bemused detachment coupled with balanced analysis gives way under the strain of her own ambivalences, producing a severely overdetermined polemic. I think it is wonderful that she had the courage to write the piece, given the complicated political cross-currents swirling around her and the state of her own feelings. In any case, I prefer Lazarus not as a candidate for Jewish hagiography but rather as a serious Jewish-American woman writer of her time, working hard to come to clarity on issues of identity and affiliation that have not gotten any easier to sort out in the hundred-plus years since her death.
