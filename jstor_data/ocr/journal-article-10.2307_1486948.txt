Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1990. x, 171 pp. At a time when we are experiencing a renewed interest in and extensive reappraisal of the literature and events of the Hasmonean era, this volume is a welcome addition. The detailed listing and evaluation of the sources which describe the activities of this dynasty from the beginning of the revolt to the death of John Hyrcanus is a valuable handbook that goes beyond simplistic description and meaningless generalization. We rather find a delineation of the issues which impinge upon our historical reconstruction of the careers of each of these rulers. Readers of the author's 1981 Columbia dissertation will find primarily stylistic improvements and bibliographic additions in this revision. The allocation of separate chapters to the origins of the revolt and to each of the Hasmonean leaders from Judah Maccabee to John Hyrcanus I provides the structure for the work. An introduction discusses the use of the sources which inform our knowledge of the time period. What is not provid- ed is a justification for the particular boundaries of the work, most particu- larly for ending with John Hyrcanus. Were it to be defined as a work based on the books of the Maccabees, it should end with Simon. It certainly is not a study of the Hasmonean period as a whole, since the tumultuous reigns of Alexander Jannaeus and Salome Alexander as well as Aristobulus and the internecine conflicts leading up to the Roman conquest receive no mention. In his introduction the author indicates his well-founded reasons for preferring Bickerman's reconstruction of the revolt and its aftermath to that of Tcherikover. In the discussion of that comparison we find the work's greatest shortcoming. While bringing us up-to-date on the sources and</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 285 issues which underlie our reconstruction of those events, he has not provid- ed us with a new synthesis of the material that is available. While admitting in his preface that through the Dead Sea Scrolls and related documents "we have been brought to pay closer attention to the great variety of social, reli- gious, and political groups to be reckoned with in Judea in this period" (p. ix), the author is really updating the perspective of Bickerman, one of the persons to whom the book is dedicated, rather than attempting to provide an emergent viewpoint which incorporates the implications of the discover- ies of the last forty years. A case in point is the author's brief discussion of Second Maccabees (pp. 7-8), in which he suggests that the Pharisees or the Asidaioi are "the only possible candidates" for consideration "if 2 Macc represents the viewpoint of any known Jewish group." Then he proceeds to eliminate other known alternatives. A case built on the use of negative criteria is methodologically problematic when we now know that the alternatives are more numerous than previously believed. We now have to recognize more clearly the limita- tions of our knowledge. This problem, of course, is most pronounced in works which confine themselves to the descriptions of the sects in Josephus, a trap into which Sievers is much too knowledgeable to fall. One of the problems with Bickerman's reconstruction is its overemphasis on the political significance of the Hellenizing faction. Sievers, for example, admits that 1 Maccabees never acknowledges the presence of Jews in the Akra (p. 86), but proceeds to follow Bickerman in his discussion of the role of that institution anyway (pp 79-83 passim). We do find hints that he wishes to move beyond this viewpoint; for example, when he suggests that the lawless who opposed Jonathan could perhaps be called Hellenizers but that there must also have been others who opposed Jonathan for the high priesthood (p. 87). Elsewhere he finds the origin of Hannukah in biblical precedents rather than in the Greek commemoration of important events (pp. 46-47). Excurses on a number of issues, such as "The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Hasmoneans," are scattered throughout the work. In his discussion of the beginning of the Hasmonean revolt, the author includes an excursus on the Asidaioi, a subject of concern to this reviewer. He properly emphasizes the frequently overlooked significance of the fact that the Hebrew term is pre- served in transliterated form, thereby providing evidence that it was not used in a generic sense but designated a specific group (p. 39). We disagree in our reading of 1 Macc. 7:12-13, in which Sievers finds no connection be-</page><page sequence="3">286 BOOK REVIEWS tween the Asidaioi and the scribes (p. 38).' Elsewhere in the work his read- ing of synag6gj in 1 Macc. 7:12 is problematic (p. 64), translating it as "assembly" rather than the more common "group" (RSV and NRSV). This forces him to treat such issues as the agenda at this assembly of scribes rather than noting the broader designation the term bears elsewhere in 1 Maccabees, such as in 2:42 and 3:44. His treatment of I Macc. 7:12 leads him to find no connection between the Asidaioi and other groups which emerge out of this turbulent era. The author has provided the material for a serious debate about virtually every issue which arises in discussions of the persons and events covered in this study. Any serious inquiry concerning Judea in the second century B.C.E. will greatly benefit from the wealth of primary and secondary material which Sievers handles in an extremely knowledgeable manner.
