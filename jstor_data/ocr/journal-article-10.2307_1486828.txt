The Gelasian Decree (6th cent.) refers to liber de Ogia nomine gigante qui post diluvium cum dracone ab haeriticis pugnasse perhibetur, apocryphus.' This remained inexplicable until 1946, when W. B. Henning, in a brilliant tour de force, partially reconstructed a work entitled "Book of the Giants" from scraps of manuscripts in various middle Iranian languages which had survived in the Turfan fragments.' It was a canonical work of Manicheism, supposedly composed by Mani himself (Reeves, pp. 9-28). Some Manichean Turfan fragments and the recently published Greek Cologne Mani Codex refer to other works known to Mani which were associated with biblical figures such as Adam, Sethel (= Seth), Enosh, Shem, Enoch, and Paul. Since the Mani Codex teaches us that Mani was brought up in an Elchasaite, Jewish-Christian sect in Mesopotamia, this is not in the least improbable.3 J. T. Milik recognized that certain manuscripts from Qumran contained Aramaic fragments of a Jewish work closely related to that which Henning had pieced together from the Turfan fragments. In all, he identified at Qumran six definite and three possible copies of this work, which he called The Enochic Book of the Giants.4 He thinks that it is quoted at CD 2:17-19, and, even if that is not a quotation, it certainly knows the story of the giants. The Book of the Giants is a Jewish work, then, connected with the narrative cycle that 1.

The Cologne Mani Codex was published in a series of articles in Zeitschrift fiir Papyrologie und Epigraphik between 1975 and 1982 by A. Henrichs and L. Koenen. A critical edition is L. Koenen and C.

The giants were the offspring of the union of the sons of God with the daughters of men (Gen 6:1), and the work names certain of them, and relates incidents which befell them, including their resort to Enoch for interpretation of a dream. Knowledge of traditions about these giants was preserved in Jewish literature from Jubilees on in various forms. The Jewish work was appropriated by the Manichees, and the Manichean forms of it are based on, but not identical with, the Jewish work. Here, then, archaeological discoveries have played a double role. The Turfan fragments established the existence of the work, which was only named in the Gelasian Decree, while the Qumran fragments demonstrated its Jewish origin. The striking convergence of Qumran and Turfan fragments has made it possible to gain some idea of the content and structure of this ancient Jewish work. All this and very much more has been set forth by J. C. Reeves in his fine study. The central part of this book is a careful re-edition and commentary on the Qumran Book of Giants manuscripts to which the parallels from the varied Manichean sources are added at the appropriate points. This central chapter is extremely valuable; the commentary is learned, painstaking, and careful, and all future work on this document will have to take its departure from it. To the texts Reeves has prefaced an excellent chapter tracing the history of the Book of Giants in Near Eastern and Western languages, and the final two chapters are "Severus of Antioch and the Book of Giants" and "Manichean Cosmogony and Jewish Traditions." He draws out the importance of this Jewish work in the formation of Mani's thought. A concluding chapter, bibliography, and indices complete the work. Reeves stresses the formative influence of Jewish traditions on Mani's cosmogony, which was based on the Enochic legend of the Watchers and Giants. Mani assimilated these views, Reeves maintains, during his youth in the Elchasaite, heterodox Jewish group in which he was brought up. These facts lead Reeves to reevaluate the role of Iranian thought in the formation of Manicheism. While not denying some knowledge of Iranian religion by Mani, he claims that "the extent of Zoroastrian influence upon the young Mani has been overrated" (p. 209). This excellent work amasses a wealth of evidence and presents it in an authoritative and balanced manner. It is a major contribution to the study of ancient Jewish literature, a commentary on one block of the complex Enoch material from Qumran, and it also throws very provocative light on</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 399 the origins of one of the great religious systems of antiquity.
