<plain_text><page sequence="1">Samuel Morell. Studies in the Judicial Methodology of Rabbi David Ibn Abi Zimra. Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 2004. xii, 345pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000372 This study focuses on the judicial methodology of the Radbaz as it is reflected in his responsa. Samuel Morell sets out to demonstrate that the Radbaz's responsa feature a high degree of judicial independence, a surprising independence from simplistic readings, a sense of principle, and a willingness to reach decisions on the basis of his own sense of what the law should be as opposed to an analysis of legal sources. In Part I of his work, Morell demonstrates these qualities as he analyzes pas sages from the responsa of the Radbaz, which Morell categorizes as the real world and the codified law, popular practice and legal interpretation, the role of equity, considerations of public policy, and sevara. In Part II, Morell considers five phrases that are generally understood to restrict judicial discretion, either by serving as mies of decision making (kelalei pesika) or as a guide to decision 192</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews making. The four that are mies are qim li ("I agree with the view of Rabbi X, whose view would support my claim"), hilkheta ke-batra'ei ("the law follows the latest authorities"), the place of the master {atrei de-mar), and the middle way. The one that is guidance is "grant that one should not add to it" {havu d? lo losif 'alah). Morell demonstrates that even these apparent restrictions on judicial discretion do not prevent the Radbaz from acting and deciding in the independent manner that Morell describes in Part I. Rather, he uses them as supports when they meet his needs and desires, and he is rarely constrained by them when they do not. Between the two parts, Morell analyzes 147 cases based on the responsa of the Radbaz, referring to many more of his responsa in the notes. Morell is a master teacher in each of these cases. His explanations of the legal issues involved, the spe cifics of the Radbaz's answers, and why he thinks these answers reflect the type of independence he believes the Radbaz exercises, are all superbly done. Reading the cases with Morell's explanations is like a course in the basics of Jewish law and halakhic legal reasoning. No reader of this book, regardless of his or her own level of competency in rabbinic literature, can be anything but impressed by the concise yet thorough explanations that the author gives on every page. His interpretations of the Radbaz's methodology are quite defensible for the most part, and, taken together, they paint a picture of the Radbaz that is consonant with the Morell's claims. One must wonder, however, whether 147 responsa out of more than 2,600 are sufficient to prove Morell's thesis. Eliyahu Ashtor, in his Hebrew work The History of the Jews in Egypt and Syria under the Mamluks, makes the opposite claim, as Morell himself notes. Ashtor argues that the Radbaz exemplifies the prototypical characteristics of the decisors of his time and place, namely, extreme conservatism, the following of precedents, the demon stration of neither creativity nor independence. Certainly, one could have quoted many responsa of the Radbaz's that fit into that pattern perfectly. Occasionally, Morell refers to other poskim of the period who dealt with the same issue and shows the difference between the independent spirit of the Radbaz compared with those others. One wonders whether a careful study of those deci sors might not also reveal an independent and creative streak in their responsa, but not on the specific issue in which the Radbaz demonstrates that type of indepen dence. That is, it seems at least probable that most poskim cannot be easily pigeon holed into a simple or single category. Even if this is tme, it does not prove that Morell is incorrect in his assessment of the Radbaz's degree of judicial indepen dence, but only questions whether it is unique to the Radbaz. It would be fascinating to attempt an analysis of the responsa of the Radbaz in which he might have shown independence of thought or decision (perhaps reflected in parallel or similar responsa of other decisors) but did not. Could one come up with a hypothesis to account for the differences between one set and the other? Having both those in which he does and those in which he does not before one for analysis might result in a stronger case for a specific view of the Radbaz's judicial methodology. Nobody would be more competent and quali fied to do so than the author of this volume. Morell also has written about the responsa of Joseph ibn Lev {Precedent and Judicial Discretion: The Case of Joseph ibn Lev.) Both volumes are a fine 193</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews contribution to the study of Jewish law and judicial methodology, for which Morell is uniquely qualified. The community of scholars in the field of Jewish law, historians of the Middle Ages, and all interested in the workings and evolution of halakhah look forward to his continued contributions to the field.
