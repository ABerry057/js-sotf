New York: Oxford University Press, 2004. xii, 324 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000669 Out of several dozen medieval Jewish commentaries on the book of Job, there are fifteen extant commentaries written by philosophers, whether as indepen dent works or as lengthy discussions in larger books. Philosophical exegesis of scripture was a literary genre adopted from the time of Philo of Alexandria on, and Robert Eisen correctly states that "a full account of medieval Jewish philos ophy must include a serious engagement with its exegetical dimension" (8). The book of Job in particular lent itself to such exegesis because of its drama, complexities, and, above all, theme. Robert Eisen's The Book of Job in Medieval Jewish Philosophy does an outstanding job of clearly presenting and analyzing how six important figures, in chronological order?Saadiah Gaon, Mai monides, Samuel ibn Tibbon, Zerahiah Hen, Gersonides, and Simon ben Zemah Duran?approached this difficult subject, both as thinkers and as exegetes. Eisen does this by exploring what he calls three "interfaces": (1) The interface between the commentary and antecedent sources: Is there a "tradition" of exeg esis? (2) The interface between the commentary and the biblical text: Is Job treated as historical fact or as allegorical fiction? Is the man Job understood to be Jewish or universal, and how is his character presented? (3) The interface 3. Heinrich Brody, ed., Selected Poems of Jehudah Halevi, trans.

In other words, Eisen treats both the book of Job and the thinkers with respect. Their interpretation of Job is not merely a literary device for promulgating a particular point of view, but rather it is taken seriously in this excellent study, both as exegesis of a text and as philosophical thought. The "three interfaces" enable Eisen to show how there was a medieval tradition of philosophical exegesis of Job, not merely isolated works; that the philosophers were sensitive and serious exegetes, attempting to bring coherence to this difficult book; and that their exeg esis reflected their larger philosophical orientation and positions. Following the exposition and analysis of these three interfaces, each chapter provides a useful summary, which is convenient in light of the necessary complex ities of the discussion and will be particularly helpful to students who are unfami liar with some or much of the material. For Saadiah Gaon, whose commentary was written before his Book of Beliefs and Opinions, the book of Job provides both ethical guidance (patience in the face of suffering) and a theological affirmation of divine justice in the face of evil. Job and his companions are historical figures (i.e., the book is not an allegory) who were Gentiles living at the time of the Exodus, and Moses was the author of the book (a view found in the Talmud). "The book of Job is for humanity as a whole ... The suffering of the righteous is clearly not just a Jewish problem" (33). Nevertheless, despite this universalism, there is also an implicit Jewish connection to the book, as Saadiah posits a parallel between suffer ing Israel and Job. "Job's trial ... like that of Israel, is designed to impress other human beings about the worthiness of those God has chosen for divine favor" (39). As for Maimonides, Eisen argues?based on his close reading of the Guide of the Perplexed and its medieval and modem commentators?that his complex theory of providence is both philosophically and exegetically grounded (73). For Maimonides, providential protection is essentially a psychological immunity from suffering. He draws on Job to develop this view. Accordingly, Job learns from Elihu that the cosmos contains a variety of natural forces that can be either benevolent or harmful, and then God reinforces this insight but adds that divine providence transcends human comprehension. This is the purpose of the book of Job, according to Maimonides. Job, once he understands the limits of human knowledge, can bear his suffering and love God more. "Job learns to divorce himself internally from his afflictions" (65). At the end of the book, then, Job attains such perfection, because true happiness?contemplating God? transcends physical well-being, and the highest knowledge of God is to know his utter unknowability, otherness, and unlikeness to us. I doubt whether the philosophers who engaged in allegorical exegesis of the Bible, beginning with Philo, would have agreed with Eisen that they were "reading philosophical truths into the text." In their view, those ideas were actually there, ready to be understood by those sufficiently intelligent and sensitive to find them and thus to read them out of the text. Nevertheless, Eisen does systematically attempt to present a coherent exegesis of the book of Job from the thinkers' 385</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews perspectives, showing how textual problems are thereby resolved. In short, the bib lical text is not merely a platform for philosophizing but must be taken seriously itself, and differences between philosophers are to be understood and analyzed on both levels. For example, like Saadiah and Maimonides, Samuel ibn Tibbon focuses on the character of Elihu as the key to the book of Job, who teaches two lessons. First, that immortality, resulting from intellectual perfection, is "the most important component of providence" ( 'ikar ha-hashgahah), a truth Job ultimately comes to accept. Second, that physical suffering is caused by natural forces, and therefore it is not directly but only indirectly attributable to God. Suffering thus teaches us that there is no direct correlation between moral virtue and physical welfare. Attachment to material things is futile, and the only true reward, accordingly, is intellectual immortality. Ibn Tibbon, understanding Maimonides' position ulti mately to be that of Aristotle?namely, that in the sublunar world, providence attaches only to species and not to individuals?infers that for Maimonides, there fore, prayer and repentance lack efficacy. Ibn Tibbon, however, regards them as efficacious because they cause a person to explore the meaning of suffering (Elihu's second point). Their efficaciousness, however, is not a function of divine intervention but merely of their pedagogic value. In Eisen 's analysis, Ibn Tibbon thus agrees with Maimonides philosophically but not exegetically. For Maimonides, the point of the book of Job is that providence means psychological immunity to suffering, whereas for Ibn Tibbon, the lesson is that providence essen tially means intellectual immortality. Eisen provides similarly careful analyses for Zerahiah Hen, Gersonides, and Simon ben Zemah Duran that cannot be discussed in great detail here. But in each case, Eisen demonstrates not only the balance of exegesis and philosophy but also the development of both as the chapters proceed. In the end, Eisen traces a circular movement, according to which Simon Duran returns to Saadiah's initial conserva tive traditionalism, if traditionalism is to be understood as the belief in a God who dispenses reward and punishment individually, that is, a (re)affirmation of individ ual providence. Accordingly, Eisen regards Maimonides, Samuel ibn Tibbon, and Zerahiah Hen as engaging in a radical spiritualization of Job. Gersonides then begins the return to a more traditional direction in philosophical exegesis of Job, affirming individual providence, which actually protects from physical harm, but basing that real providence on Aristotelian premises?namely, an imper sonal God who does not need to intervene?because providence is based on human intellectual perfection. Duran continues that return to traditionalism by stripping providence of its Aristotelian intellectualism and reaffirming the per sonal God who rewards and punishes. Nevertheless, Duran's traditionalism is phi losophic in method and borrows from his more radical predecessors. My only disappointment in Eisen 's solid and valuable study relates not to what is in it but to what is not, in two regards: individual and general. On the indi vidual level, it seems to me that there should be some discussion of Abraham ibn Ezra, who (as Eisen notes) was criticized by Zerahiah Hen for not writing a philosophical commentary to Job. Eisen says that his list of philosophical commen taries on Job excludes Ibn Ezra's commentary because Ibn Ezra's interest is almost 386</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews exclusively in the peshat, and (as Nahum Glatzer pointed out), "Ibn Ezra's com mentary contains not even a single reference to his theory of evil, which is men tioned numerous times elsewhere in his commentaries and should have been relevant to his reading of Job ... The philosophical material here is too meager to render the commentary a philosophical one" (238 n. 12). Fair enough; so Ibn Ezra doesn't merit a full section or chapter of his own. However, it would be inter esting to learn why, in Eisen 's view, this is true. Ibn Ezra's other commentaries are replete with philosophical material and insights, so of all his many commentaries, why not his commentary to Job? Moreover, even if Ibn Ezra's commentary to Job is not generally philosophical, his reference there to Saadiah and his rejection of his predecessor's reading of Job 1:6 (which Eisen discusses) would make for an inter esting, if brief, juxtaposition of their views. Ibn Ezra would also have been useful for exploring further the idea con sidered in the chapter on Gersonides, that the Jews have a collective providence when they obey the Torah. Regarding a special providence for Israel, we find a clear parallel in Ibn Ezra's astrological theory that the nations are governed by their respective stars or constellations but that Israel has no constellar sign ( 'ein mazal le-yisra'el) and is ruled providentially directly by God, so long as the Jews observe the Torah (in his long commentary to Exodus 32:21). Similarly, Ibn Ezra would have provided an interesting comparison with Maimonides. In some respects (although obviously without its astrological com ponent), Ibn Ezra's astrological theory bears at least a formal resemblance and par allel to Maimonides' theory of providence in the Guide of the Perplexed 3:17 and especially 3:51. As we have seen, for Maimonides, providence functions in accordance with intellectual attainment by attaching in the sublunar world only to species, not to individuals, with the exception of human individuals, to whom it attaches in proportion to their intellectual development, by which they transcend the corporeal individuality and participate in universal knowledge. This knowledge enables them providentially to avoid harm, or at least to be psy chologically immune to its effects. The parallel to Ibn Ezra's astrological theory lies, then, in humans having a way, by virtue of the astrological knowledge acquired by their rational soul (neshamah), to connect directly to the supreme intellectual realm of the angels, who are of the same species as the rational soul and whose power is superior to that of the higher powers of the stars in the inter mediate realm. This knowledge enables them astrologically to avoid the harmful effects of astral decrees (although not to change those decrees per se). In both cases, Ibn Ezra's theory of astrology and Maimonides' theory providence, it is thus intellectual knowledge (with the Torah also playing a role in the scheme) that is the basis of a person's ability to transcend the fate of terrestrial creatures and to escape harm by connecting the individual person with a higher, universal, and permanent realm. In short, reference to Abraham ibn Ezra's astrological theories would have provided an interesting comparison to some of the discussion on providence in Maimonides and Gersonides, in the very least case by contrast, and perhaps even by enhancing our understanding of how medieval Jewish philosophers the orized about the nature of providence and how it functions in the world. 387</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews Finally, on the general question of what is not included in the book, in his last chapter, Eisen presents a brief survey comparing some medieval and modem (Jewish and non-Jewish) exegetical approaches to Job. The Book of Job in Medieval Jewish Philosophy has whetted our appetite for more, and the last chapter is really just a plate of tantalizing appetizers showing us what could still be done by Eisen in future studies.
