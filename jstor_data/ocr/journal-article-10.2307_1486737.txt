Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1996. 223 pp.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 111 This useful book is an attempt to correct the tendency of modem schol- arship to assume that "a given lexeme or passage has but one meaning or interpretation" (p. 14). Scott Noegel has a keen eye for the many different types of wordplay that one finds in the Hebrew Bible, but he has dedicated this monograph to the phenomenon called Janus parallelism. The term "was coined by Cyrus Gordon to describe a literary device in which a middle stich of poetry parallels in a polysemous manner both the line that precedes it and the line that follows it" (p. 12). The book begins with an introduction to Janus parallelism followed by a brief discussion of why scholarship needs to pay greater attention to this poetic device. Noegel then has a slim chapter on previous biblical scholarship on this subject. Chapter 3, the vast bulk of the book, contains an updated collection of over forty previously unrecognized examples of Janus parallelism in the book of Job. Each example is briefly explained by Noegel, who also takes into account whether any ancient or modem commentators noted the possibility of a secondary meaning for the word or words that form the heart of each Janus parallel. Here Noegel makes very compelling arguments for each of the examples he cites. The book is extensively well researched and includes several appendices as well as a full bibliography. The first appendix covers previously unrecognized Janus parallels found elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible. A second appendix includes Janus parallels found outside of the Hebrew Bible, primarily in other ancient Near Eastern texts but also one instance from the Quran and a few from medieval Jewish poetry. The third appendix includes a discussion of certain suggested instances of Janus parallelism, mostly from a variety of texts found within the Hebrew Bible, that Noegel rejects as true Janus parallels, while noting that they may contain other types of wordplay. On the whole, this book is thorough and written in a concise, erudite fashion. Noegel's philological skills are exemplary. The book's major draw- back is that it is primarily a collection of individual arguments about a number of previously unrecognized Janus parallels. Noegel spends too little time discussing how knowledge of such wordplays might influence a host of interpretive decisions that could radically alter one's whole interpretive approach. Although he occasionally touches upon such questions, especially in his conclusion, where he argues that the interdependence and interplay between these wordplays indicate that Job has a greater degree of literary unity than often acknowledged, Noegel does not devote enough attention to these issues. I wished that he had taken the time to apply more of what</page><page sequence="3">112 BOOK REVIEWS he discovered in his close philological readings to the larger hermeneutical questions with which biblical scholarship is currently wrestling. Had he done so, one suspects that this book would read less like a dictionary and more like a monograph. There are also a few minor typographical errors. Not unexpectedly they are in the Hebrew quotations from the Bible. They include a missing line of Hebrew text in the discussion of Hosea 2:8-9 on page 151, an error in the order of the Hebrew words that occurs in the discussion of Hosea 4:2-3 on page 152, and two misspelled Hebrew words in the discussion of Jeremiah 25:10-11 on page 183.
