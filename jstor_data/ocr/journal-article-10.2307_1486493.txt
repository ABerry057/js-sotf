<plain_text><page sequence="1">Roman A. Ohrenstein and Barry Gordon. Economic Analysis in Talmudic Literature: Rabbinic Thought in the Light of Modern Economics. Studia Post-Biblica 40. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1992. xviii, 152 pp. R. A. Ohrenstein and B. Gordon, both professional economists, have written a very useful and innovative little book. The authors demonstrate that the Talmud anticipates later developments in political economy and economics and, hence, is a valuble source for students of the history of economic thought and for historical economists. In my judgment the book should prove to be equally or even more valuble for scholars of the Talmud and of the ancient world generally. Many ancient historians and students of ancient languages are understandably put off by the technical jargon and mathematical formulations of contemporary economic theory. However, Ohrenstein and Gordon strive for accessibility and they succeed. Their economic theory is not formalized, but it is relevant and sound. The authors deserve applause, not least from economists, for employing lucid prose to mine the "economic treasures" of the Talmud. Most surprising and enlightening for the reviewer is the recognition in the Talmud of a positive role for economic self-interest or selfishness. A positive social role for selfishness was of course central to Bernard Mandeville's famous and controversial The Fable of the Bees (1705). Mandeville's insight was carried forward by Adam Smith in his Wealth of Nations (1776). Smith wrote that the self-interested economic actor is often led by an "invisible hand" to promote the interest of society. The Mandeville/Smith doctrine has been formalized by contemporary economists who state the precise conditions for a market economy to produce a socially optimal allocation of society's scarce resources. (Briefly, markets must be competitive rather</page><page sequence="2">198 BOOK REVIEWS than monopolistic, and private property rights must be fully defined and enforced.) That "private vices" might promote "public benefits" would not have shocked the talmudists, as is demonstrated by a fable based on a story in the Babylonian Talmud. The talmudic "Fable of the Evil Impulse" concludes that: At last it dawned-a truth profound In scheme divine-a principle sound: Vicious forces as passion, avarice, and greed Are vehicles of progress the world doth need. (p. 38) Moreover, the rabbis stressed that individuals also have the capacity to act from altruistic motives. But classical economists under the spell of Mandeville and the Smith of the Wealth of Nations constructed powerful models, albeit of circumscribed applicability, that assume purely selfish motives (the "economic man"). Ohrenstein and Gordon might have mentioned that in the past few decades economic theory has more and more returned to the position of the rabbis. Economic theory has been enriched by the incorporation of altruistic motives into economic models.' On the other hand, the midrashic proposition that current private investment behavior might reflect sympathy with unknown future generations (pp. 42-43) is completely alien to modem economic analysis. I am not aware of any model of private investment decision-making that incorporates concern for anonymous future others. In this respect the economists, I believe, are closer to the truth than were the ancient rabbis.2 The talmudists, Ohrenstein and Gordon show, had at least a rudimentary understanding of many later developments in economic theory, including the 1. For a seminal contribution to this literature, see David Collard, Altruism and the Economy: A Study ofNon-Selfish Economics (Oxford, 1978). On the role of altruism in historical economic development and retrodevelopment, see Morris Silver, Affluence, Altruism, and Atrophy: The Decline of Welfare States (New York, 1980). 2. This is not the only instance in which the rabbis and modem economists might analyze an economic problem differently. According to Rabbi Hanina (3rd cent. C.E.), if the price of grain is relatively low but grain is not easily obtainable, then, if I understand the authors (pp. 48-50) correctly, it might be justified to interfere with market forces. If the price were "low" and the product unavailable, modem economists would immediately become suspicious that a maximum-price law was being enforced. Such laws when effective produce a shortage, i.e., the quantity supplied is less than the quantity demanded at the controlled price.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 199 role of supply and demand in price determination, imperfect competition, the "harvest theory" of cycles in aggregate economic activity, opportunity cost, risk and uncertainty, and a more than rudimentary insight into game theory. It should be noted, however, that the rabbis had predecessors in the Near East. Take, for example, the concept of opportunity cost: "the cost of devoting resources to one particular line of production is measured by the benfits forgone by not devoting them to an alternative line of use" (p. 58). The early second millennium B.C.E. Laws of Eshnunna (paragraph 22) already show an awareness of opportunity cost in requiring that "If a man has no claim against a(nother) man, but nevertheless distrains the other man's slave girl, the owner of the slave girl shall [decla]re under oath: 'Thou has no claim against me' and he (the false distrainer) shall weigh out as much silver as much as the hire of the slave woman."3 It becomes obvious that the ancients were not totally innocent of economic principles. To conclude, Ohrenstein and Gordon have written an excellent book. It will repay study by historians of economic thought, scholars of the Talmud, and all students of the ancient world. Economic Analysis in Talmudic Literature has an additional pay-off for noneconomists. I refer to the opportunity to become familiar with many basic principles of modem economics in a relatively painless fashion.
