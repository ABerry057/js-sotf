Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2005. xiv, 241 pp. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001116 Generally speaking, compared to the situation immediately after the estab lishment of the state of Israel in the late 1940s, the relations now between Israel, on the one hand, and the Vatican and other Christian churches, on the other hand, are more "normal" and realistic. With certain Christian churches, par ticularly with some parts of the Evangelical Church, the relations are even very close, and Israel gains from them substantial moral, political, diplomatic, and some financial support. Though there are still some tensions and clashes between the Israeli government and certain Christian churches, such as between Israel and the Greek Orthodox Church (concerning its property and the appoint ment of the archbishop in Israel), there is a considerable amount of mutual accep tance between Israel and most of the Christian churches. But, as this very innovative and impressive book by Uri Bialer (whose title is vivid and provocative) demonstrates, this was not the situation during the first period after the establishment of Israel until 1967. During that period, the relations between the Israeli government and most of the churches were very contentious and challenging. From the point of view of the various churches, these highly pro blematic relationships were connected to Israel's isolation in the international system and the accompanying refusal of many states and churches to recognize the new state. To a certain extent, this position of the states and the churches was, in turn, connected to their preferred relations with the Middle Eastern Arab states and to reactions to the fate of the Palestinians, as well as to the results of 195</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews the 1948 war in Palestine, including the damage and destruction inflicted on many churches in Palestine during that war. The discussion of the Israeli position is the main focus of this original and thoughtful book, which is based on very thorough and methodical examination of the files of the Israeli government and other governmental archives. The book pre sents the first scholarly analysis, based on newly declassified documents, of Israeli policy making on this issue. Part 1 of the book deals mainly with the Israeli pos ition and policies vis-?-vis the Vatican. Part 2 of the book deals with the presence of Christians in Israel, with Israel's dealings with missionary activities, with the Christian communities, and with the land assets and properties of the German Lutheran, Catholic, and Greek Orthodox churches in Israel. As Bialer correctly notes, the establishment of the state of Israel and its mili tary achievements, especially in regard to the new state's borders and the conse quent bad fate of the Palestinians, created difficult problems for the newly established Jewish state. Thus, except for the much later Israeli peace agreements and cold relations with Jordan and Egypt, the Israeli-Arab-Palestinian conflict continues until now. The refusal of the international community to recognize the political, geographic, and demographic results of the 1948 war, therefore (and, in fact, the results of other Israeli-Arab-Palestinian wars), created for Israel an image of existential security threat. Bialer emphasizes that one of the most formidable problems that Israeli foreign policy faced was the stance of the Christian world toward the new state. He comments that during the early period, these attitudes ranged from hostility and categorical nonrecognition by the Catholic Church, to Protestant ambivalence, to Evangelical limited support. Bialer focuses on the weight on Israeli policy makers of the modes of think ing, which were then and still are deeply rooted in Israel, about the impacts of the very long tradition of historical Jewish-Christian interactions. His main thesis is that these traditional Jewish attitudes toward Christianity were deeply rooted and had a tremendous impact on Israeli governments' policies and actual decisions. As an example, Bialer discusses the Israeli reaction to the possibility of the visit of Catholic pilgrims in Israel in 1950, a holy year on the Catholic calen dar. Bialer quotes Israeli officials, who wrote that the danger of such a flow of pil grims would lie in the almost certain possibility that the pilgrimage could cause a political confrontation between the Catholic world and Israel, especially concern ing Israel's control of West Jerusalem and the future of the holy places in that city. There was further fear that such a pilgrimage might have implications concerning the behavior of the Catholics in Palestine, who purportedly "have always been hostile toward us [the Jews]," and then "demonstrations and outbursts will force us to intervene and there will be a worldwide outcry" (188), One must note, however, that things have changed since 1967. Thus, despite Israel's formal annexation of the old city after that war, such pilgrims are now coming to Israel and are welcomed by the Israeli government and most Israelis. The Jews' bitter memories of their historically highly problematic relations with Christianity played a major role in the policies of the Israeli government during the early period of the state of Israel. These memories included, among 196</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews other things, the Crusades, the Inquisition, the exile from Spain, and much later, the cooperation of the Catholic Church with Mussolini and Hitler before and during World War II. Obviously, these had a very clear negative influence on Israel's position vis-?-vis the church. Bialer rightly notes that beyond the highly hostile emotional attitudes toward the Catholic Church, there were also some Israeli instrumental considerations, such as the imbalance between the various churches with regard to their attitudes toward Israel, the unfriendly attitudes that they adopted publicly in the international arena, and the internal challenges that they posed for Israel. All these emotional and cognitive factors "helped foster an Israeli attitude of political fatalism toward the Christian world, particularly the Catholic Church, which explains why Israel neglected to collect and process information about the Church for most of the period discussed in this book" (191). However, one must add here that not all Israeli senior politicians shared these views. For example, Moshe Sharet, Israel's first minister of foreign affairs and second prime minister, held a different view in this respect. He visited the pope, tried to pursue a more moderate policy toward the church, and attempted to protect the Christians, their churches, and lands in Israel during the period dis cussed in this book. Bialer's book is different from other publications in this sphere. Whereas most of the literature has focused on the theological perspectives and on the atti tudes and policies of the various churches toward Israel, Bialer's book concen trates on the Israeli political perspective. Indeed, it offers a new perspective and explanation of Israeli relations with Christianity, and especially with the Catholic Church. According to Bialer, "the confrontation between Israel and the Catholic Church was a clash between two complex and unique systems, which undoubtedly made it difficult for the Vatican to initiate attempts at rapprochement. The newly opened files in the Israeli State archives provide, however, resounding proof that Israel also found it difficult, though to a lesser degree" (192). All the aspects of this complex phenomenon that are discussed in this book make it an original publication dealing in a highly scholarly and clear fashion with an important dimension of Israeli foreign policy during the two first decades after the establishment of Israel. It is highly recommended to the general public, poli ticians, and religious leaders and to students of these issues during that period.
