<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kenneth Seeskin. Jewish Philosophy in a Secular Age. Albany: State Univer- sity of New York Press, 1990. x, 246 pp. It has often been argued that Jewish philosophy is as misguided an enter- prise as Jewish mathematics would be. Like mathematics, philosophy is rational, and thus it can no more be Jewish or Christian than mathematics or chemistry. And yet, the notion of Jewish philosophy persists and re- appears in the title of the book under review. Does Seeskin reject the analogy between philosophy and mathematics? Does Seeskin see philo- sophy as an enterprise with deep roots in religion, art, and history, so that it is always conditioned by the culture in which it arises? Does the author of this work reject the idea of a universal reason that is above specific times and</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 247 places as a logocentric illusion in dire need of deconstruction? Or is there less than meets the eye in Seeskin's use of the term "Jewish philosophy," referring to something that is essentially philosophy in the universal sense and Jewish in a most secondary sense? The book under discussion is an important contribution to the contem- porary Jewish philosophic dialogue. Written clearly and with genuine scholarship, and drawing upon a broad spectrum of philosophic writings both Jewish and general, the author ranges over some of the most central issues in the philosophy of religion and Judaism. Particularly noteworthy is the author's willingness to take stands where some are more comfortable summarizing alternatives without drawing conclusions. For Seeskin, Jewish philosophy is philosophy done in a Jewish way. Philosophy is done in a Jewish way when the primacy of practical reason and the transcendence of the rational are maintained, two theses "which a gentile can assert as easily as a Jew" (p. 4). The primacy of practical reason means that human beings should be more concerned with their moral duties than with obtaining theoretical knowledge about the world. The transcen- dence of the rational means "that it is impossible for the ideal to be realized in a sensuous medium" (p. 5), which is the philosophic equivalent of the Jewish conviction that God is separate from the world and cannot be depict- ed by means of images. Any philosophy, it seems, which advances these two theses is Jewish in the sense that it is done in a Jewish way, whether it is done out of Jewish or general philosophic motives. Perhaps Seeskin's most basic conviction is "that the only content we can ascribe to our idea of God is moral" (p. 63). Seeskin is an agnostic on crea- tion and the status of eternal truths. But why not agnosticism in the moral realm? Seeskin's answer, following Kant, is that it is only in the moral realm that the human being is unconditioned and therefore breaks through to the absolute. But the absolute that is reached is a moral absolute in a constitu- tive sense, so that the very idea of the moral law and God blend into each other to such a degree that the two can no longer be distinguished. The problem comes to a head in the issue of "suspending the ethical," the title of a chapter in Seeskin's book. As could be expected, Seeskin is not very comfortable with the A qedah. Since we are certain that murder is wrong but never certain that a commanding voice is that of God, when a voice claiming to be that of God commands murder, we must conclude that it is an evil demon that is speaking rather than God. Had Abraham had the benefit of a proper philosophical education, he would have rejected the com- mand to sacrifice his son as a command that could not possibly come from</page><page sequence="3">248 BOOK REVIEWS God. At this point, the true God should have revealed himself and praised Abraham for not being deceived by the voice of the divine impostor. Seeskin's enemies are the existentialists, a term he does not define but whose meaning we can gather from his usage. (Strangely enough, Seeskin never mentions that there are atheistic existentialists who are as unwilling to submit to God's arbitrary authority as he is.) An existentialist accepts God's authority merely because it is God's. The existentialist believes in a com- manding presence that precludes testing the command morally and accept- ing or rejecting it as it does or does not correspond to rational morality. God, according to Seeskin, cannot demand that the human being sacrifice his or her rationality in the service of God. God never acts in an arbitrary fashion. "The only authentic commands," writes Seeskin (p. 119), "are those for which reason can discern some purpose." But is there an arbitrary dimension to reason itself? Seeskin quotes (p. 50) Descartes' letter to Mersenne in which Descartes argues that the truths of mathematics are what they are because God made them so. God created a world in which contradictions cannot both be true, but he could have creat- ed a world in which only contradictions are true. Similarly, God created a world in which murder is evil, but he could have created a world in which murder is good. It is for this reason, Seeskin concludes, that "it is but a small step from the voluntaristic God of Descartes to the ethically indif- ferent God of Fear and Trembling" (p. 55). For Seeskin, the laws of reason are not creations of God but somehow equivalent to God. In any case, reason is not subordinate to the arbitrary will of God. Jewish Philosophy in a Secular Age is a valiant attempt to resurrect Jewish rationalism. The author's deepest loyalty is to universal philosophi- cal reason. Yet there is also a secondary loyalty to Judaism, and he is there- fore determined "to find a philosophic justification of ideas that, as a matter of fact, have a source in the sacred literature of Judaism" (p. 165). From my perspective, a primary loyalty to Judaism and a secondary loyalty to philo- sophy make for better Judaism and better philosophy. But a secondary loyalty to Judaism is better than no loyalty at all. Michael Wyschogrod Baruch College of the City University of New York New York, N.Y.</page></plain_text>
