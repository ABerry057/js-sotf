Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990. viii, 255 pp. Moneylending provided the major source of livelihood for the Jewish communities of medieval Christian Europe, particularly in the centuries fol- lowing the First Crusade. Even after Jews were expelled from England and</page><page sequence="2">232 BOOK REVIEWS most regions of Western Europe, the Jewish moneylender, usually imagined, like Shakespeare's Shylock, as an avaricious and merciless creditor, remained a potent inhabitant of the European mind. Joseph Shatzmiller's extremely well documented volume (126 pages of text, 39 of appendices, and 57 of notes) challenges this negative image by examining evidence from the archives of Marseilles connected with a fourteenth-century lawsuit involv- ing Bondavid Draguignan, a Jewish moneylender accused by a Christian debtor of making a fraudulent claim. During the trial, the moneylender's lawyer presented twenty-four Christian witnesses, including several nobles and leading citizens, who swore to Bondavid's good character and honora- ble and generous business practices. Shatzmiller uses this court action as the basis for his discussion of the general issues of medieval moneylending, usury, indebtedness, and Jewish- Christian relations. It is his argument that "side by side with expressions of resentment and frustration, contemporary documents present expressions of recognition and appreciation for a benign and generous Jewish money- lender" (p. 1). Shatzmiller believes that study of the documents, which give us access to the experiences and attitudes of real medieval people of differing social classes, will lead us to "cast aside the perception of an unbroken his- tory of hatred and misunderstanding between Jews and Christians in the Middle Ages, and to acknowledge the existence of friendship, consideration, magnanimity, and mutual recognition in the relations between members of the two societies" (p. 123). Shatzmiller's intermediate chapters, on general issues connected with moneylending, explain that "medieval people were never absolutely clear about what they wanted to do in the matter of usury" (p. 46), and he identi- fies four components in this widespread popular ambivalence. These include two sets of closely linked oppositions: first, the Christian religious ideology against any gain connected with the lending of money, which was in direct contention with the need for a widespread and well-entrenched credit sys- tem; and second, the welcome profits gained by the crown from the activity of Jewish moneylenders, which conflicted with royal desires to relieve those oppressed by usurers and simultaneously demonstrate piety (ultimately expressed by expelling Jews). Shatzmiller notes that despite widespread recognition by both church and state of the contribution of "usurers" to the economy, by the thirteenth century "restrictive legislation on the part of civil and ecclesiastical authorities, combined with bitter opprobrium on the part of people permanently under the pressure of time to discharge their debts made the lives of moneylenders intolerable" (pp. 44-45).</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 233 Jews were never the only moneylenders in the Middle Ages, nor were they predominant. In Marseilles, for instance, native Christians and Italian bankers "handled far larger sums than the Jews and catered to a higher class of clientele" (p. 93). Indebtedness was virtually universal at every level of medieval society, and many individuals would owe money simultaneously to Jews, Lombards, and indigenous Christians. Thus, Shatzmiller raises inter- esting questions about Jewish efforts to attract and maintain a loyal clien- tele, and offers a cogent description of ma'arufiya, the Jewish legal category of preferred customers. A ma'aruflya was an individual with whom a Jew had an established business relationship, and whose custom the Jew culti- vated by offering especially good terms or by providing special services, such as postponement of repayment, remittance of part of the owed interest, or not asking for security in connection with a loan. The documents in the case of Bondavid Draguignan, particularly the twenty-four depositions in his favor, make it clear that such privileged relationships did exist, that money- lenders were often generous, and that they might be defended by their customers in positive terms. Still, a willingness to acknowledge honest and generous business prac- tices does not constitute friendship. Bondavid's financial transactions, however magnanimous, were still business deals between a creditor and a debtor who were also Jew and Christian. No matter the special treatment, few people feel warmly toward those to whom they owe money, and the added opprobrium heaped upon Jews as usurers and deicides by the church further exacerbated existing resentments. In 1318, a year after Bondavid's trial, a harsher definition of usury was enacted in Marseilles under church pressure, with negative consequences for moneylenders and would-be borrowers. Shylock Reconsidered provides a fascinating and detailed illumination of medieval moneylending and jurisprudence. That women, both Jewish and Christian, are shown by the documents to have been among the lenders, borrowers, and litigants is but one of the myriad insights it offers into social and economic life in fourteenth-century Southern France. With its extreme- ly thorough notes and bibliography, this book, despite its perhaps overly sanguine view of Jewish-Christian relations, is a significant contribution to medieval Jewish social history.
