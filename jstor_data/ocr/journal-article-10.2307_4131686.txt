New York: New York University Press, 2005. x, 310 pp. In this new contribution to the history of life stages, Melissa Klapper argues that at the turn of the twentieth century, Jewish girls played an important role in their families' Americanization by demonstrating how to acculturate to America while maintaining a Jewish identity. Focusing on two youth pastimes, education and leisure, Klapper's narrative shows that both served as avenues for socialization and acculturation while allowing Jewish tradition to thrive. Concentrating on the period 1860-1920-when society increasingly viewed adolescents as a social group with shared activities, responsibilities, character- istics, and expectations-Klapper explores Jewish girls' acculturation through their educational pursuits. As adolescence became associated with formal school- ing, middle-class Jewish girls often attended school or were tutored at home. Working-class girls, in contrast, frequently relied on alternative learning opportu- nities within the family, on the street, in community centers, and through print media, lectures, and cultural activities. No matter how or where Jewish girls were exposed to American ideals, they learned that embracing middle-class gender ideology (different roles for men and women with regard to home and work) was one path toward acculturation. At the same time, Jewish girls also received religious education in Jewish ritual, history, and literature at synagogues, religious schools, community institutions, and in the home. For girls, Klapper asserts, a Jewish education helped preserve their religious and cultural heritage by teaching that "Jewishness offered something valuable and precious even to Jews living, almost for the first time, in an environment where they actually had the choice of whether or not to honor their religious heritage by identifying with it" (237). As a result, Jewish girls were in a unique position within the family to negotiate the tension between acculturation and tradition. As American girls, they benefited from the tendency of American parents to keep girls (rather than boys) in high school, and so they had more time to inves- tigate the aspects of American culture and identity. As Jewish girls, they benefited from "the traditional lack of emphasis on Jewish girls' [religious] education," which "actually made it easier to convince parents of the benefits of modem or experimental methods of religious instruction" (179). Thus, through education, Jewish girls learned and helped their families to navigate between tradition and assimilation. 469</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Another element of the developing adolescent youth culture that Klapper addresses is the leisure culture, which was formed at school and through other activi- ties. Aspects of this culture for girls included feminine graces (playing piano, dancing), reading, and clubs. Jewish girls wanted to be typical American girls, defined by good health, independent spirit, and cultivated taste. Although the poten- tial existed for a clash between the pressures to be American girls and Jewish girls, Klapper indicates that, in fact, the conflict was minimal because "so many of the behaviors and values of American girlhood and traditional Jewish girlhood were similar" (190). For example, American high standards of morality coincided with Jewish values. Parents often encouraged a leisure culture among youth because it allowed children to interact with a pool of potential spouses. However, Klapper points out, working-class girls were disadvantaged in this realm-because they were in school for shorter periods and thus participated less in the construction and expression of girl culture-and had a harder time "approaching the American component of their identity" (191) than did middle-class girls. Both educational and leisure activities prepared girls for their roles as adult women, who would be the primary Jewish teachers of their young children and older daughters and would later participate in clubs and societies. In their liminal position between child and adult, Jewish girls struggled with their identity and their place in society, but in the process, they forged for themselves and their families a path that allowed them to acculturate to America and maintain their Jewishness. Girls' identities likely evolved, Klapper stresses, "from a series of intersections in a spiral course where tradition and modernity merged and diverged" (235). In Jewish Girls Coming of Age in America, Klapper unearths the lived experience of turn-of-the-century Jewish girls by exploring a diverse collection of sources, including personal and institutional papers and American Jewish periodical literature. Although this work emphasizes Jewish girls, Klapper also addresses how their experiences differed from those of Jewish boys, a treatment that allows her to fully explore girls' roles within their families. Fur- thermore, her focus on Jewish girls-with their multiple identities as adoles- cent, female, Jewish, and American-pushes the historiography on American girls and girlhood beyond its traditional concentration on urban, middle-class, northeastern Protestant girls. Although Klapper's book addresses the late nine- teenth and early twentieth centuries, she highlights fears that resonate today: that religious education would take a back seat to secular endeavors and that the extracurricular nature of religious instruction would threaten Jewish continuity.
