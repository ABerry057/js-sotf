<plain_text><page sequence="1">Alan L. Mittleman. Between Kant and Kabbalah: An Introduction to Isaac Breuer's Philosophy of Judaism. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1990. x, 227 pp. Isaac Breuer (1883-1946) belongs to that last generation of German Jewish thinkers whose lives and intellectual legacies were culturally orphaned by the dispersion and destruction of German Judaism. In this book, the first on Breuer's thought in English, Mittleman reaches back across the historical chasm to reclaim Breuer for our times, and to demon- strate that Breuer is not a mere philosophical ideologue, but a "real philos- opher" of significance for contemporary religion (p. 32). He is an "expres- sion of a cultural synthesis that is no more," through whom, however, "voices older than those of German Jewry ... speak to the ages" (p. 188). In the opening chapter of the book, "From Frankfurt to Jerusalem," Mittleman suggests sources, influences, and formative experiences from the</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 337 stations of Breuer's biography. Three chapters of philosophical exposition are then followed by a brief "Critical Appreciation," an argument for Breuer's abiding significance which is sympathetic, eloquent, and yet cogni- zant of Breuer's limitations. Mittleman's philosophical exposition explains the book's surprising title-Between Kant and Kabbalah. Breuer's relationship to Kant was para- doxical. He did not construct a philosophy of Judaism in a Kantian frame- work, as Hermann Cohen did, for he believed "Judaism to be singular, divine and extracategorical" (p. 12). Kantian critical philosophy serves only in a negative role, to help understand "the human condition into which Judaism enters" (p. 12). In his memoirs, Mein Weg, Breuer wrote that he had studied Kant "as a Jew," finding "in his arsenal the weapons to defend the holy terrain of the Torah" (p. 31). Breuer's epistemology limits the terri- tory of reason, reserving a metaphysical realm for Torah, which can be affirmed not by an act of cognition, but only by an act of will. Here Mittle- man demonstrates Breuer's complex dependence on Schopenhauer (pp. 43-49, 51-62). The pivotal concept in Breuer's metaphysics is the concept of creation. The "world-in-itself" is given, and this givenness is "creation." Hence crea- tion is taken here not as an event, but as an aspect of reality (p. 76). The "world-as-nature," on the other hand, is the world as known through rea- son. Mittleman explains Breuer's varying positions in Die Welt als Schop- fung und Natur, Der neue Kusari, and in Elischa and Nahaliel, indicating his turn to Kabbalah. The possibility of two levels of discourse, one mundane, the other divine, is an idea for which Breuer found a precursor in R. Isaiah Horowitz. The "world-as-nature" is accessible to the intellect; the "world- in-itself" is the "interior" aspect of nature. Mittleman considers Breuer's conception of "Sabbath of creation" (pp. 79 ff.) relevant for us now as a model not for the synthesis, but for the coexistence, of natural science and religion. The Sabbath is the "repose of God," in which the lawfulness of nature was fixed, a barrier which makes knowledge possible within its domain, and impossible beyond it. Breuer relegates "science" and "reli- gion" to two distinct "frames of reference" (p. 83). This two-leveled conception of the world, "world-as-nature" and "world-as-creation," is paralleled in Breuer's thinking by two aspects of Torah, the Torah as phenomenon, consisting of rational word signs, and the "Torah-in itself." This is more than a mere parallel; it is an "essential rela- tion" (p. 114). Echoing a kabbalistic tradition, Breuer asserts that the obser-</page><page sequence="3">338 BOOK REVIEWS vance of the commandments is an "ontological activity." Here is the motive of Breuer's brand of Zionism: Israel must embody the Torah. Redemption involves enactment of the Torah law in the state. This nexus is the subject of Mittleman's chapter "Law, Nation, History and Redemption." Breuer claimed that his dissertation, a treatise on Rudolf Stammler's concept of law, was a key to understanding his own thought. Mittleman shows how Breuer, in his critique of Stammler, articulates his own root problem: how freedom is possible within the framework of obe- dience to extrinsic law. Breuer also gives a remarkable explanation of the seeming inequalities of Jewish laws pertaining to women and other social classes. He argues that these inequalities apply only to the distribution of duties among classes of individuals. The task of ethics is to enjoin the fulfill- ment of these duties, not to judge their distribution, which is divinely given. Mittleman rightly takes note of this quite obscure argument in his critique: Breuer's system leaves no place for individual rights; it knows only of classi- fication of duties. The antidemocratic thrust of Breuer's legal philosophy cannot be ameliorated by sympathetic reworking. The reader of Mittleman's book profits from the clearly prodigious research and thought which went into its making. Other features of Mittle- man's scholarly style are an obstacle to the enjoyment of the book. His lang- uage, while occasionally elegant, is often overladen. (e.g., pp. 113, 126). He uses trendy terms ("disprivileging," "postfoundational," "postsynthetic"), and peppers his text with Hebrew and German words, usually to illustrate translations, most of which are obvious. Neologisms and philosophical- linguistic innovations require explanation, and receive it. Scholarly craftsmanship, however, is of lesser import than the substance of Mittleman's argument. He considers Breuer relevant for two reasons. One is Breuer's argument "for a renewal of Jewish peoplehood, based on a reappropriation of sacral and sacramental aspects of that peoplehood. He offers a version of a resacralized peoplehood that avoids, at least in princi- ple, the dangerous pitfall of romantic nationalism" (p. 176). Breuer's anti- Zionist Zionism flows from the duty to establish a state true to Jewish law. The other reason lies in Breuer's epistemology: "He argues for the pri- macy of Jewish Being, expressed as participation in and loyalty to normative Jewish community, over culturally conditioned projects of theoretical, theological reason.... Breuer's insistence on standing in a community of discourse as a condition of intelligibility implies irreducible cognitive plural- ism" (pp. 175-176). Breuer thus indirectly dismisses the problem of the incompatibility of science and religion. "This dismissal is his real contribu-</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 339 tion to Jewish thought" (p. 177). Here Mittleman sees the possibility of interpreting Breuer as a philosopher who, anticipating our "post-modern" era, engaged in a "thorough deconstruction of reason, or more broadly, of modern intellectual Kultur" (p. 9). The question remains whether Mittle- man, while allowing that he is expanding on Breuer here, has not overlaid Breuer's critique of philosophy with contemporary issues which would have been alien to him. Nonetheless, Mittelman's thesis is a thought-provoking conclusion to a book which, in itself, is a "real contribution to Jewish thought." Robert S.
