INTRODUCTION In 883 CE, a man appeared in Kairouan, one of the centers of Jewish life at the time and told a tale about the lost tribes of the Northern Kingdom.' He called himself Eldad and claimed to be from the tribe of Dan. Since then, the story of the Ten Lost Tribes-that the tribes of the Northern Kingdom still exist intact in a far- away land, living in exile beyond the sabbatical river, a mysterious body of water that was passable only on the Sabbath-has continued to generate excitement. It is astonishing, however, to realize that this motif did not develop until many cen- turies after the fall of the Northern Kingdom. After the destruction of the North- ern Kingdom, many northerners remained in their ancestral homeland in the north. Other northerners lived among their southern compatriots in Judah after fleeing south, while deported northerners and southerners mingled in exile in Meso- potamia. It is only after the end of the Second Temple period that the notion of the Ten Lost Tribes, inviolable and unreachable, developed. There is, then, a sharp disjunction between what actually happened to the northern tribes and the memory of what happened to them. Fathoming how this rift occurred requires us to enter the enchanted realm where the events of the past are transformed into memory. For most of the millennium after the fall of the North- ern Kingdom, the existence of northerners living among southerners was assumed. The creation of the Septuagint, for example, according to the Letter of Aristeas, and its very name, are predicated on the existence of all twelve tribes.2 Six elders from each tribe were sent by the High Priest at Ptolemy's request, and the name of the resulting translation was derived from their total number of seventy-two. Yet, just after the end of the Second Temple Period, a new assumption emerged-north- erners were isolated in a distant land. II. THE FATE OF THE NORTHERNERS Understanding this transfiguration of memory must start by examining what in fact did happen to the population of the North. The evidence demonstrates that 1.

Three circumstances served as an impetus for northerners to escape deportation: (1) Earlier Assyrian attacks and deportations of population, both in the region in general and in the Northern Kingdom in particu- lar, warned of what might be in store for the future and may have inspired north- erners to flee in anticipation. (2) The conquest of Samaria was interrupted, allowing northerners an opportunity for flight. (3) The Assyrians in the end en- forced only a partial exile, leaving many northerners in their native land. IIa. Prior Assyrian Attacks The Israelites knew about the Assyrian deportation policy. Amos, an eighth century BCE prophet to the north, warns the northerners that they will be exiled, and although he does not name the Assyrians directly, Amos refers to population transfers that will occur in the future (Amos 5:5, 27; 6:7; 7:11, 17).3 Hosea, a north- ern prophet from the eighth century BCE, admonishes the northerners that they will end up in a foreign land (Hosea 8:9; 9:6; 11:5). The Assyrians had already begun to pressure the North by dismembering it piece by piece, starting more than a decade before the North's total capitulation.4 Tiglath-Pileser III5 had put pressure on the North in 738 BCE during the reign of Menahem, who was forced to raise money from 60,000 landowners (50 shekels from each for a total of 1,000 talents of silver)6 to preserve his hold on the king- dom (2 Kings 15:19).7 Assyrian inscriptions also record that Menahem was among 3. Hayyim Tadmor and Mordechai Cogan, II Kings (Anchor Bible; New York: Doubleday, 1988), 175. Shalom M. Paul argues that the Israelites were not affected by the Assyrians during the pe- riod of Amos's prophetic office because Assyria was ruled by a series of ineffectual kings during that time (Amos: A Commentary on the book ofAmos, Hermeneia [Minneapolis: Fortress, 1991], 1, 198). Amos must have completed his prophetic office, according to Paul, before 745 BCE, because there are no clear indications in the book of the domestic misfortunes that occurred after the death of Jeroboam II or of the military advances of Tiglath-Pileser III. However, while the enemy threatening the Israelites remains anonymous in the book of Amos, this enemy is portrayed as utilizing deportations, a policy initiative of Tiglath-Pileser III. (On Tiglath-Pileser's new policies, see Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq, 3rd ed. [London: Penguin, 1992], 307). 4. K. Lawson Younger Jr., summarizes the campaigns against the North in "The Deportations of the Israelites," Journal ofBiblical Literature 117 (1998): 201 -27. Younger notes that Tiglath-Pileser III alludes to his previous campaigns (in the plural) in his account of the campaign of 732 BCE, im- plying that a number of campaigns against the Northern Kingdom were undertaken before the cam- paign of 732 BCE. 5. The Assyrian king Pul is considered to be Tiglath-Pileser III.

The enormous size of the tribute is most likely attributed to the fact that Menahem was a usurper who purchased Assyrian support with his tribute. Huge quantities of tribute were also given by other kings with shaky claims to their throne (see Tadmor, The Inscriptions of Tiglath-Pileser III, 171, 208</page><page sequence="3">At the Nexus of History and Memory the kings of the west who delivered tribute to Tiglath-Pileser III-although the amount is not recorded in this inscription, it is reasonable to assume that both the biblical and Assyrian inscriptions refer to the same event.8 This tribute was exact- ed by Tiglath-Pileser III from the northern king Menahem and other rulers bor- dering the Assyrian provinces newly established by his successful campaign against Syria and Phoenicia in 738.9 In 734 BCE, the Assyrians were in Gaza as part of a process to gain control over the commerce of the Mediterranean seaports.'l The presence of the Assyri- ans was probably the primary cause of the anti-Assyrian coalition of Israel and Aram, rather than the usual explanation that the Assyrians were drawn to the re- gion by the anti-Assyrian coalition."I The Assyrians wanted to control the coastal strip and the Phoenician and Philistine cities for commercial reasons, and as part of this process, they subjugated the western part of the Northern Kingdom along the coast into the Assyrian province of Dor. The first deportation from the North was carried out by Tiglath-Pileser III in 733-32 BCE. During the reign of Pekah, according to the biblical text, the As- syrian emperor assumed control over the northern parts of the western tribes and over Gilead and exiled the population to Assyria (2 Kings 15:29).12 This Assyrian invasion of the Galilee and Gilead'3 is also recorded in a number of inscriptions from the Annals and other inscriptions of Tiglath-Pileser. 4 Summary Inscription 4:6'-7' records the annexation of land from the Northern Kingdom:15 n. 16'; Bustanay Oded, "Phoenician Cities and the Assyrian Empire in the Time of Tiglath-Pileser III," Zeitschrift des deutschen Paldstina- Vereins 90 [1974]: 49). Hulli of Tabal (explicitly called "a son of nobody") paid 10 talents of gold and 1,000 talents of silver (Tadmor, The Inscriptions ofTiglath-Pileser III, 171 [Summary Inscription 7, rev. 15']) and Metenna of Tyre paid 50 (or 150) talents of gold and 2,000 talents of silver (Tadmor, The Inscriptions of Tiglath-Pileser III, 171, 191 [Summary Inscription 7, rev. 16'; Summary Inscription 9, rev. 26]). 8.

The Chronicler has apparently combined two notices about deportations in Kings. According to 2 Kings 15:29, Tiglath-Pileser III sliced off the northern area of the tribes on the western side of the Jordan and Gilead on the eastern side of the Jordan and forced them into exile in Assyria. The exact location of their Assyrian exile was left unspecified. In 2 Kings 17:6, Shalmaneser captured Samaria and ex- iled the population to Halah, the Habur, Hara, the river of Gozan, and the cities of Media. The Chron- icler has combined the Assyrian king from the first passage with the location of the places to which the population was exiled from the second passage and has transformed the exile that included part of the eastern population to include all of the eastern population and none of the western population.

The total number of deportees, 13,520, is less than comparable figures from the conquest of Samaria, 27,280 (or 27,290), or of Hamath, 30,300. How much of the population of the Galilee does this number represent? Zvi Gal argues that the Galilee was depopulated after the deportation but not deserted. In his archaeological survey, he has found a significant decline in the set- tlement of the Lower Galilee at the end of the eighth century, a decline that con- tinued to the sixth century.32 Gal also estimates that the total population of the Lower Galilee at the time was between 17,600 and 22,000 people. If the figure from Tiglath-Pileser III's inscriptions includes only the number of deportees from the Lower Galilee, then we can obtain an enumeration of the remaining popula- tion. At that time, 4,000 to 8,500 people remained in the Lower Galilee: this would be approximately 23 to 39 percent of the previous population. This is clearly a sig- nificant loss of population, but it is not a complete obliteration of the population of the Lower Galilee.33 Indeed, perhaps as a reflection of the continuing presence of northerners in the Galilee, Tiglath-Pileser did not transfer population to there, an exception to the general practice of the Assyrian empire. Furthermore, a strong connection may have developed between Judah and the essentially pure Israelite population of the Galilee, as evidenced by queen mothers from the Galilee during the reigns of Judean kings after the fall of Samaria (2 Kings 21:19; 23:26). Their being from the very cities ravaged by Tiglath-Pileser III may indicate that the cities remained Is- raelite.34 There are a number of other references that may indicate other deportations 30.

Zvi Gal, Lower Galilee During the Iron Age (Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 1992), 109. Gal writes that the Galilean hills, or upper Galilee, were deserted from 700-600 BCE ("Galilee," The Oxford Encyclopedia ofArchaeology in the Near East, 2:370). 33.

However, two scholars have argued that the Galilee was almost completely depopulated. Younger argues that the remaining population was neg- ligible and that the reason the Galilee was left deserted was to ensure unchallenged Assyrian access to the important Damascus-Megiddo-Egypt route and to the Philistine cities ("The Deportations of the Is- raelites," 213, 225). Megiddo was rebuilt as an Assyrian city, and there are indications of other Assyr- ian residences elsewhere in the Galilee. However, if the Assyrians wanted to preserve their control over the region, why did they not move a docile population into the area, like they did elsewhere? Another scholar, Nadav Na'aman, argues that the Galilee had poor economic potential and political importance and was, therefore, left depopulated ("Population Changes in Palestine Following Assyrian Deporta- tions," Tel-Aviv 20 [1993]: 106). However, Na'aman fails to account for the difference between the to- tal population of the Galilee and the number of deportees. 34.

One of Tiglath-Pileser's re- liefs records a deportation from As-tar(a)-tu, Ashtarot, a city in Transjordan.35 1 Chronicles 5:6 refers to a Reubenite chieftain exiled by Tiglath-Pileser III, and Judges 18:30 refers to the priests ministering to the Danites until their exile. The Assyrians continued to pressure the North in other ways. They were in- formed about events internal to the Northern Kingdom and may have instigated some of them. While the biblical text records that Pekah was overthrown by Hosea without any outside interference, a Summary Inscription of Tiglath-Pileser re- cords, along with the deportation from the Northern Kingdom during the reign of Pekah, that Pekah was overthrown and that Tiglath-Pileser III may have been the one who had Pekah killed and Hosea installed as king.36 15' ... .The land of Bit-Ijumria (Israel) 16' [ ... . its] auxiliary army, [ ... ] all of its people, 17' [ ... ] I carried to Assyria.

The immense tribute received by Tiglath-Pileser III at that time, ten talents of gold and an unknown number of talents of silver, indicates an amount that a usurper would offer to shore up his claim to the throne. Other inscriptions record the coup d'ytat. Summary Inscription 13:18' recounts the attack on the Galilee and the over- throw of Pekah.37 Summary Inscription 9: rev. 10 recalls the depredation of the Galilee and the installation of Hosea.38 Summary Inscription 9: rev. 11 recounts that Hosea appeared before Tiglath-Pileser.39 The Assyrians also tightened the vice on the Southern Kingdom. Another Summary Inscription recounts the tribute paid by the Judean king Ahaz to Tiglath- Pileser III.40 Also at this time, the city of Gezer may have been taken from the Southern Kingdom. The coastal plain north of Gezer became an Assyrian province, and a relief, now lost, shows an Assyrian attack on Gezer.41 The Assyrian pressured the Northern Kingdom for more than a decade be- south, Gal argues that although a mother of a Judean king was identified as from Yotba, this does not necessarily mean that the site was occupied during the seventh century (see 2 Kings 15:33; 2 Chroni- cles 24:1). The city of Ruma, associated with another royal mother, might be located in Samaria (Judges 9:41) or even in Judah (if there was a graphic confusion of the letters dalet and resh, Joshua 15:52). 35.

Sections of the Northern Kingdom were sheared off, and the Assyrian empire manipulated the monarchy of the North. Israelites were deported by the Assyrians, and northern prophets admonished the northern- ers that they would be exiled. The inhabitants of the North had ample warning of what the future would bring, and although we cannot be certain, northerners may have taken heed before the total capitulation of their country and fled south. We can be certain of the other two factors that allowed the northerners to escape, the delay in the process of the conquest of Samaria and the limited scope of the de- portation from the North. lib. Interruption in the Conquest of Samaria and the Extent of the Deportations from Samaria The conquest of Samaria and the concomitant vanquishing of the Northern Kingdom were interrupted, allowing northerners to escape, and when the deporta- tion from the North after the fall of Samaria from the North did occur, the Assyr- ians exiled only part of the population. Shalmaneser V captured Samaria shortly before his death after a two-year siege.42 The city fell in late summer or early autumn 723 BCE, and when Shal- maneser died in the winter of 722 BCE, the deportations were at most in their very earliest stages.43 Upon Shalmaneser's death, his army retreated to Assyria. When Sargon established himself on the throne a year or so later, he engaged in a lengthy process of pacifying the citizens of Assur and countering the increasing strength of the Elamites and their alliance with Merodach-Baladan of Babylonia.44 Only after this did he launch a campaign to the west, in 720 BCE, to deal with the for- merly subjugated cities, Hamath, Arpad, Simirra, Damascus, and Samaria, that shook off Assyrian rule in the meanwhile.45 Sargon's quelling of Samaria was part "Excavations at Gezer," BiblicalArchaeologist 30 (1967): 43-44; Tadmor, The Inscriptions ofTiglath- Pileser III, 210. Bob Becking suggests that Tiglath-Pileser III conquered Gezer, a town that may have belonged either to the northern or southern kingdom, because of its strategic importance in controlling entry to the Judean hill-country (The Fall of Samaria, 9-10). An attack by Tiglath-Pileser III on the southern kingdom, although without any specification with regard to Gezer, is mentioned in 2 Chron- icles 28:20-although this is not found in 2 Kings-Chronicles may have preserved an historically ac- curate record. Two cuneiform tablets from the seventh century BCE have been excavated at Gezer, possibly attesting to Assyrian control: see Bob Becking, "The Two Neo-Assyrian Documents from Gez- er in their Historical Context," Jaarbericht Ex Oriente Lux 27 (1981-82): 76-89. Becking also argues that Gezer was in fact part of the Northern Kingdom before the Syro-Ephraimite War. 42.

The Great Summary Inscription48 (23 -25) I besieged and captured Samaria. I took as booty 27,290 people who lived there. I gathered 50 chariots from them. And I taught the rest (of the de- portees) their skills.49 I set my governor over them, and I imposed upon them the (same) tribute as the previous king. The Nimrud Prism50so (25-30) [The inhabitants of Sa]maria, who agreed [and plotted] with a king [hostile to] me, not to endure servitude and not to bring tribute to Assur and who did battle, I fought against them with the power of the great gods, my lords. (31-33) I counted as spoil 27,280 people, together with their chariots, and gods, in whom they trusted. (33-36) I formed a unit with 200 of [their] chariots for my royal force. I settled the rest of them in the midst of Assyria. (37-41) I repopulated Samaria more than before. I brought into it people from countries conquered by my hands. I appointed my commissioner as governor over them, and I counted them as Assyrians. It may appear that if this deportation were only from the city of Samaria, this number, either 27,280 or 27,290, seems improbable. The archaeologists who ex- cavated the site offered population estimates varying from 25,000 to 40,000 peo- ple but recognized that the water supply system of Samaria could not sustain more than a few thousand.5' Moreover, the only clearly inhabited area of the site is the royal/administrative compound, that is, the area inside the casemate walls-an area of about 1.96 hectares-which would have 500 inhabitants at most.52 The area 46.

Therefore, the figures of 27,280 or 27,290 appear unrealistic. There are, however, other considerations that must be analyzed in determining whether the figure is reasonable. While the number could include refugees swarm- ing to the city during the Assyrian invasion, it is doubtful that the capital could have had sufficient room for them. A more likely explanation is that the entire kingdom was called Samaria by the Assyrians, and the deportation mentioned refers to the en- tire kingdom, not just the capital.53 It is also possible that the number refers to the total number of deportees from the region of Samaria flooded by other northerners displaced by either Tiglath-Pileser III, Shamaneser V, or Sargon II. Granted that the number of 27,280 or 27,290 deportees could be realistic, it must be emphasized that it would still consist of only a small part of the popula- tion of the Northern Kingdom as a whole, no matter which estimate of the popula- tion is used. The current methodology used to determine the density of population is based on two methods of calculation.54 One is based on analogy with the popu- lation of traditional societies that survived until the twentieth century, and the oth- er is based on the housing layout of excavated sites. The density coefficient obtained by these methods is 25 people per dunam (250 per hectare)." According to this method, the overall built-up area of the Lower Galilee, 90 hectares, held 22,500 people in Iron Age II. The overall built-up area of Samaria, 410 hectares, held 102,500 people. The Northern Kingdom, as a whole, had a population of about 350,000.56 The population of Judah was 110,000 people. Their combined population reached 460,000 people. In comparison, the city-states of Philistia held only 50,000 people. This estimate of the percentage of the population of the North show that the deportation from Samaria represented only a small part of the population of the North. Other estimates are similar in leading to this conclusion. Adam Zertal notes that the deportation from the North after the fall of Samaria was composed of less than half of the population of the region of Samaria, and obviously that percent- age, 20 to 25 percent in his estimation, would be less for the population of the North remains of the final Israelite occupation probably belong to the period of Assyrian occupation (Tappy, The Archaeology of Israelite Samaria, 2:174-226). 53.

Another piece of evidence about the percentage of the Israelites deported comes from the Persian period. The settlement pattern during the Persian period was in two particular areas, the Dothan Valley and the region around the area of Samaria. Eighty percent of the sites in the Dothan Valley were newly founded in the Persian period. A possible explanation points at a continued Israelite presence in the North. A verse from Judith, a book that reflects both the Persian and Hel- lenistic periods, indicates that the community in the Dothan Valley consisted of northerners who had returned shortly after the rebuilding of the Temple (Judith 4:3). The Dothan Valley had already been heavily settled during Iron II,59 and there is no evidence that the Assyrians deported large numbers from the Dothan Valley. According to this argument, the Israelite population of the Dothan Valley remained and increased so heavily that new settlements were founded in the Persian period. More evidence that the Northern Kingdom was not drained of population comes significantly from a study of the material remains in the province of Samaria in the period of Assyrian occupation.60 According to the material remains, life af- ter the conquest continued much as it had before the conquest. The ceramics pre- serve a consistency in style from the eighth into the sixth centuries with a modicum of development. Only new administrative and military posts reflect new architec- ture and material remains, where new settlers were placed in sites founded by the Assyrians. Apparently, they decided to keep the native population of Israelites and the population of new settlers separate. The Assyrians left most of the towns and villages intact and demolished only some of the larger cities. A new upper class was brought in from Babylonia and perhaps Syria (2 Kings 17:24), and this may reflect that only the upper class of the Northern King- dom was deported. Other biblical texts refer to others brought in by the Assyrians at a later period. Esarhaddon brought in a group of colonists (Ezra 4:2; Isaiah 7:8b), as did Assurbanipal (Ezra 4:10). 57. A.

Zertal uses the nomenclature Iron III to distinguish the period of 722-587/6 BCE from the period 1000-587/6, because he believes that the standard desig- nation, Iron II, which includes the entire period from 1000-587/6, is overly broad and does not allow the historical significance of 722-587/6 to emerge. 58.

The Assyrian deportations were very limited in scope, and most northerners were not deported. The Assyrians allowed them to re- main in their northern homeland. The other critical factor that allowed northerners to escape deportation is that the transportation of the Israelite deportees was interrupted. First, the death of Sen- nacherib and the concomitant flight of the Assyrian army back to Assyria allowed the inhabitants of Samaria and other northerners an opportunity to escape. Second, even after Sargon II reasserted control over the Northern Kingdom, the deporta- tions did not occur immediately. The deportation of the Israelites to the cities of Media, for example, could not have taken place until after the Assyrians took over in 716.61 The cities of Media mentioned in the Bible were the city of Harhar and its neighboring towns, which had already been incorporated into the Assyrian em- pire in the previous century but were lost when a civil war broke out at the end of the reign of Adad-nirari III in 783 BCE. These cities were located in a border re- gion: while the Assyrians raided further east, their administrative control stopped there. The Assyrians had ample reason to be concerned about controlling Harhar itself. Even after they had taken control of the city, the population revolted when it was formally turned into an Assyrian province, probably because they feared be- ing deported themselves. Bringing newcomers without ties to the area was an As- syrian method of ensuring loyalty. Northerners were deported there for this reason, but the deportation could not have occurred until years after the fall of the North, allowing northerners the time to leave and escape deportation. An indication of the flight of the northerners southward is that in the very late eighth century, the size of the city of Jerusalem increased to three or four times its former size.62 This expansion was not a result of natural population growth or of the economic attractiveness of the city. Judah did not experience any increase in trade during this period when the international trade routes bypassed it. The pop- ulation expansion was caused by two factors: the immigration of the Israelites from the North and the refugees from the areas in Judean territory that the Assyrians ap- propriated from the Judeans and transferred to Philistine control. After the fall of Samaria, Jerusalem grew from a size of 32 acres in the eighth century to 125-150 acres in the seventh century and from a population of 6,000- 61. I. M.

Until the expansion of Jerusalem into the upper city at the end of the eighth century, Jerusalem remained on the narrow strip of land of the Lower City, the Ophel, and the Temple Mount. Tombs in the area that would become the Upper City were still in use during the eighth century, indicating that the area was still uninhabited because no cemetery was located inside the city (ex- cept for the royal cemetery).63 An Iron II C structure has been excavated under the Broad Wall built by Hezekiah at the end of the eighth century and demon- strates that the city expanded prior to the building of the wall. This indicates that the population had already swelled before the direct threat to Jerusalem posed by the Assyrians in the final years of the eighth century BCE. In addition to the eighth- century expansion before the attack in 701 BCE, suburbs were located outside of the Broad Wall to accommodate the expanded population during the seventh century. The two sets of finds, the late eighth-century expansion and the seventh- century expansion, indicate two waves of growth, the first between the Assyrian attack on the North and the Assyrian invasion of the South and the second after the Assyrian siege of the South: the first consisted of refugees from the North, and the second was the influx from the Judean territories transferred to Philistine control. During the same time that Jerusalem expanded, a parallel expansion was oc- curring elsewhere in Judean territory. The number of settlements in the Judean hill country increased by 40 percent, and abandoned sites were repopulated.64 There was a significant increase in inhabited areas in the Negev and the Judean desert.65 There is also the possibility that a number of sites were founded after the destruc- tion of the North in the northern part of the Judean hill country, the part of Judean territory that borders on the Northern Kingdom.66 That northerners were coming to the Southern Kingdom is indicated indi- rectly by biblical material that reflects northern traditions. Deuteronomy's phrase- ology and religious ideology parallel that of Hosea, a northern prophet, and these points of contact may indicate a northern origin for Deuteronomy.67 Judean finds in northern territory during Iron IIIa in sites such as Samaria, 63.

Ac- cording to biblical texts, Josiah launched a campaign northward to incorporate the people living in the area around Samaria in his kingdom (2 Kings 23:15-20 [in 622]; 2 Chronicles 34:6-7 [628]).69 As we have seen, there is ample evidence to conclude that the northern de- portees consisted of only a part of the population of the North. Many northerners were not exiled, whether they remained in the geographic area of the North or whether they lived in the Southern Kingdom after fleeing there to escape the As- syrians. Unlike the fascinating tale of the Ten Lost Tribes borne away in exile to the farthest reaches of human habitation, most northerners remained in their home- land or lived in the Southern Kingdom. And as we shall see, those northerners who were deported did not disappear to an unreachable Shangri La. Quite the contrary. III. THE ISRAELITES IN EXILE The Israelite deportees did not fade away in exile. Indeed, they were joined by their southern compatriots in less than two decades. The northerners and southerners were resettled near each other. The places to where the northerners were deported according to 2 Kings 17:6 were: 1. Gozan (Tell Halaf), the capital of the Assyrian province Bit Bahian, is on the Habur River.70 The notation of Gozan as a river in the biblical text, rather than a city, is an error. Gozan is an Aramean city that had been brought under Assyrian rule about 800 BCE. Habur is a tributary of the Euphrates and is a district of the same name, northwest of Assyria, mostly settled by Arameans.71 2. Halah (Akkadian halahha) was a district north of Nineveh.72 3. The city Hara is unknown. 4. The cities of Media are on the eastern periphery of the Assyrian empire. The northern deportees according to the biblical text were resettled in both border areas and central Assyria. The biblical accounts in 2 Kings 18-19, Isaiah 36-39, and 2 Chronicles 32 do not mention any deportation from the Southern Kingdom in 701 BCE,73 but 68.

Mordechai Cogan notes the ambivalence in the sources incorporated in the book of Kings. For the Deuteronomistic historian of 2 Kings 17: 34-40, the Israelite exiles have forfeited their rights to restoration by their continued idolatry, a sharp contrast to the actions of Josiah, who moves into Northern territory incorporated as an Assyrian province to destroy the altar in Bethel and to rid the oth- er towns of their bamot (2 Kings 23:15-19; 17:29) ("Israel in Exile-The View of a Josianic Histori- an," Journal of Biblical Literature 97 [1978]: 40-44). 70.

Solving the conundrum of the number of attacks on Judah and the success or failure of the 220</page><page sequence="15">At the Nexus of History and Memory there are a number of oblique references in prophetic literature ascribed to prophets who lived at the time of the exile in 701 BCE that warn of destruction and depop- ulation (Isaiah 1:4-9; 5:5-6, 13; 6:11-12; 7:20; 10:33-34; Micah 1:16).74AnAs- syrian inscription records that when Sennacherib attacked the Southern Kingdom in 701, he took 200,150 captives from the Southern Kingdom.75 This number, 200,150 deportees,76 seems exceptionally large, especially, in light of the number taken from the far more populous Northern Kingdom (27,280 or 27,290) and the population of the South in general (only 110,000).77 It has been explained in a number of ways: 1. A.T. Olmstead argues that just as 1,235 sheep in Sargon's display inscrip- tion increased to 100,225 in his annals, the number 200,150 was originally 150 [sic] deportees, an intentional inflation.78 2. A. Ungnad casts doubt on the number 200,150. He notes that the number of captives, 208,000, from Babylonia deported in the first campaign of Sen- nacherib was only slightly larger than the deportation from Judah and that Sargon's deportation from a large number of villages, either 140 or 146, depending on the version, was significantly less, 6,170 or 20,170 deportees.79 Ungnad argues, there- fore, that the number of deportees from Judah is not correct and that the cause of the inflated quantity was an inadvertent scribal error, not an intentional overstate- ment. The scribe erroneously wrote 2 ME.LIM instead of 2 LIM because he erred in reading a decimal number as sexagesimal notation. Ungnad argues that the ad- dition of ME was the cause of the discrepancy in the number of sheep in the Sar- Assyrian campaign(s) is beyond the scope of this essay. For a survey of the issues and theories, see John H. Hayes and J. Maxwell Miller, Israelite and Judaean History (London: SCM Press, 1977), 446-51. 74. Some of the texts about exile in late eighth-century prophets may be linked to the Baby- lonian Exile of the sixth century. Isaiah 11:12-16 could be compared to the highway in the desert of Deutero-Isaiah, 40:3-4; 42:16; 57:14; 27:8, reflecting an exilic date, but also could be compared to Hosea 11:11, evidence for an eighth-century date. 75.

Unfortunately, Sennacherib's "Letter to God" breaks offjust where it recounts the booty of livestock and where it might tell of human deportees (Nadav Na'aman, "Sennacherib's 'Letter to God' on his Campaign to Judah," Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 214 [1974]: 25- 39). 77. The total number of all Assyrian deportations for which there is unequivocal evidence is 157, with at least 1.2 million people exiled. To give an idea of how many people were deported, of the 43 deportations for which we have complete enumerations, 13 cases have more than 30,000 deportees each, eight cases have between 10,000 and 30,000 deportees, and 22 cases have less than 10,000 de- portees. See Bustenay Oded, Mass Deportations in the Neo-Assyrian Empire (Wiesbaden: Dr. Ludwig Reichert Verlag, 1979), 18-19. This total number of deportees is summed up from the documents that contain numbers. Oded refers to a statistical calculation for an estimate of all deportees of 4.4 million plus/minus 0.9 million (Oded, Mass Deportations, 20, n. 5). 78. A.T.

A number of scholars have sought to refute Ungnad's proposal. Rykle Borger argues that this was impossible because the scribes were adept at reading numbers accurately and copying them accurately.80 Bustenay Oded argues that Ungnad's proposal, that all x-hundred thousands in Neo-Assyrian texts be read x thousands, is in direct contradiction to the explicit wording of the text.81 Marco de Odorico points out that the discrepancies in numerations are often difficult to link to scribal errors and that low numbers, such as thousands or ten thousands for prisoners, appear realistic, while the large numbers appear questionable in our eyes.82 Some of these low numbers are rounded, a number that could result from an approximation given to the author of an inscription, an approximation made by the author of the inscription, or an approximation invented by the author when he had no data. The smaller numbers should be considered as suspicious as the large numbers. 3. Stephen Stohlmann argues for the nuanced veracity of the number 200,150.83 He believes that the number 200,150 refers to the inhabitants of the Judean towns captured who were liable to deportation and that in the course of time only a partial number of the possible deportees were in fact deported. Stohlmann derives this from three pieces of data. First, the royal inscription specifically states that the Assyrian king took them as booty, ashlul, rather that he brought them out, usesamma. This, according to Stohlmann, means that the inhabitants of Judah were taken out of their towns and counted but not deported at that time. Second, when the Rabshakeh speaks to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, he tells them when they sub- mit to Assyrian rule, they would eat of their own food and drink of their own wa- ter until he returned to deport them (2 Kings 18:31-32). This wording implies that the deportation would take place some time later and in fact, according to Stohl- mann, was never completed. Third, there is no indication that the Assyrians re- populated the region: if the complete number of deportees were removed from Judah, the land would have been left vacant and would need to be repopulated. The problem with Stohlmann's proposal is that this way of counting would be unique among the Assyrian royal inscriptions. 4. Raymond Dougherty and W. E Albright argue, based on archaeological evidence, that the towns mentioned in Sennacherib's inscription as destroyed were not.84 Albright extended this argument to mean that 200,150 were counted as sub- 80.

The archaeological evidence on which Dougher- ty and Albright base their contention has been decisively refuted.85 5. Marco De Odorico argues in his systematic analysis of the enumerations in Neo-Assyrian royal inscriptions that the numeral 200,150 was deliberately de- signed to expressed both vastness and precision, creating an atmosphere of veri- similitude, and, therefore, by implication, the number is contrived. De Odorico writes: The tendency to use higher number shown by Tiglath-Pileser's inscriptions will be fully developed in Sargon and Sennacherib's times. Their inscriptions are quite inclined to use "very high-exact" numbers deriving from the sum of a very high "round" number with an "exact" one on the order of some hun- dreds and some tens (as, e.g., 100,225, or 200,150). These numbers in some cases appear very artificial, owing to their form of "round numbers exacted," and are subject to numerous variations. It is therefore unlikely that they could be the sum of partial accountings represented by "round" and "exact" quanti- ties ... On the contrary, there is not a single example of a very high number formed by a single digit, as would be, e.g., 100,000. The nearest to it is per- haps represented by the ... 120,000 men of Shalmaneser III's armada, a num- ber that was not taken up by later inscriptions. Thus, apparently, while in earlier periods the use of "round" numbers on the order of thousands or of some tens of thousands seemed proper or sufficient, when passing to higher magnitudes (hundreds of thousands), a change in this "policy" was necessary. Numbers on the order of hundreds of thousands with a single digit, as "100,000" or "200,000," would have resulted in abnormally inflated figures, and therefore not realistic at all.86 In Sennacherib's inscriptions, the strategy implemented is to use figures on the or- der of hundreds of thousands that are "exact." The amount 200,000 reflects a high number and the amount 150 conveys an exactness meant to promote realism. De Odovico explains the impetus for the new strategy of quantification by noting, "The new imperial dimensions and aspirations toward a (truly) universal domin- ion would explain the tendency to increase the numerals, both in relation to the di- mensions of the palaces and to the deeds narrated in the foundation deposits or on the inscribed bas-reliefs."87 De Odovico argues that while the numbers in Assyri- an royal inscriptions in general may still be far from reality, they do reflect other sim," Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 47 (1932): 3-17. They argue that there was no evidence of widespread destruction at Lachish in 701 BCE and that Stratum III, with its remains of large-scale destruction, reflects the actions of the Neo-Babylonian empire. 85.

They may not have any practical import in texts that are not receipts or other commercial documents, but they do reflect a de- sire on the part of the Assyrians to magnify their victory. Indeed, Sennacherib's account is shaped so as to emphasize the degradation of Jerusalem and the capitulation of Hezekiah. For example, the freeing of Padi, king of Ekron, from his confinement in Jerusalem, and his restoration to the throne, is described after the capture of Ekron, even though it must have occurred after the capture of Jerusalem at the end of the campaign.89 A major goal of Sennacherib's campaign was to subdue Hezekiah, probably one of the leaders of the anti-Assyr- ian coalition, and to weaken Judah, the most powerful kingdom in the region.90 The best proof of the success of Sennacherib's expedition is that his successors, Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal, did not have to campaign against any western al- liances or against Judah. The number 200,150, then, was designed to look realistic and to emphasize the magnificence of the Assyrian victory over Judah. It does not represent the ac- tual number of deportees from the Southern Kingdom, and we do not have any data by which we could reconstruct the number. However, we can use archaeological data about the extent of settlement be- fore and after the Assyrian invasion. The population of Judah in the Iron IIB lived in an area of 1,500 acres.91 In Iron IIC-III, the inhabited area is about 1,000 acres. Jerusalem remains the same size, 150 acres. The extent of the destruction in Judah is reflected in the major sites that were destroyed and remained depopulated in the seventh century (Beth Shemesh, Tell Beit Mirsim), and the Shephelah shows 25 percent of the number of inhabitants in the seventh century as compared to the eighth century.92 Clearly, then, the Assyrian military campaigns brought about havoc in the demography of Israel and Judah.93 Death and deportation reduced the population. The takeover of the Northern Kingdom inspired a migration of northerners south- ward, and the Assyrian transfer of the western provinces of Judah to the control of the Philistine city-states caused Judean refugees to move to other parts of Judean territory. Those inhabitants of the Southern Kingdom, whether native Judeans or escaped Israelites, who were deported by the Assyrians as a result of the 701 cam- paign were taken to Nineveh, near Halah, to where northerners were deported. They joined their already deported compatriots in Assyrian exile. 88. De Odorico, The Uses of Numbers, 2, 159. 89.

The exile of the northerners at the time of the fall of the North becomes part of collective memory, but there is complete silence about the deportation from Judah. Judean exile in 701 is not recounted in any fashion. The northerners remaining in the North are invisible. The northerners who fled south are never mentioned. The amalgamation of northerners and southerners in the Southern Kingdom or in Assyrian exile is passed over in silence. The reality of what happened was forgotten. The Deuteronomistic History, the major historical narrative of the Bible, makes the effort to explain the past in moral terms, and that attempt determines what is remembered and what is forgotten. In 2 Kings 17, the North is utterly condemned and, therefore, is exiled. Northerners who do not fit into the category of exile are disregarded. The exile for the South is deemed to be later, at the hands of the Baby- lonians, and so southerners who are exiled by the Assyrians in 701 are ignored. IV THE EXILE The silence about the Judean deportees of 701 is striking because the As- syrians, in general, attempted to increase the success of the resettled deportees by allowing transplanted communities to stay together as homogeneous small groups and did not disperse them as individual families.94 The deportees from the North- ern and Southern Kingdom were allowed to retain their communal identity and were resettled in such a way as to increase the potential of preserving their com- munal independence. Those deported by the Assyrians, whether Israelite or Judean or other, appeared to live as free persons-marrying, owning property (land, slaves, silver), and engaging in business and legal transactions.95 The greatest per- centage of deportees were resettled into the main cities of Assyria,96 and the prin- cipal Assyrian cities were cosmopolitan, harboring non-Assyrian communities. Those deportees resettled as farmers may have had a less uniform status, and some were tied to the land they cultivated.97 Deportations were also tied to the needs of the Assyrian war machine.98 Deportees were incorporated in the Assyrian army, filling the ranks, and deportees were also used to replace Assyrians in domestic occupations so that Assyrians could serve in the military.

Other names, for which there is no proof that they are exclusively Jewish, names that might be Hebrew or Canaanite, names that might be Phoenician or Hebrew, names that might be Hebrew or Aramean, must be left to the side and not included.105 For example, of the Jews of Nippur that have been identified, 38 had Yahwistic names, 23 had West Semitic names, 6 had Akkadian names, and 2 had Iranian names.106 There are no more than 70 identifiable Jews out of 2,500 individuals mentioned in the Murashu archive, 3 percent of the popu- 99.

It never occurs in Phoenician or Punic names. Names with yhw cannot be Phoenician for phonological reasons: a name in the form qatal + (divine name) in Phoenician would be qat6l + (divine name) in a Canaanite language like Hebrew. 105.

Those found in Assyria are found mostly at Kalhu, Kouyunyik, Nineveh, Gozan, Ma'allinite and Assur as well as scattered elsewhere. In Assyria, the num- ber of individuals is 65 ? 3, and in Babylon, 152 + 8. We must remember that archival documentation is limted to urbanite Babylonians, to whom cuneiform writing was confined.112 In Neo-Assyria, there are at least 19 documented people who might have been Israelite or Judean, if the documentation derives from after 701. Most Jews were tenants or holders of small or medium fiefs. 13 A variety of examples can at- test to the range of material: 1. An individual named Paqaha, mentioned in a document from 710-09, was an estate manager and may have been exiled as early as 732-31 by Tiglath- Pileser III.114 2.

This shows that Israelites rose to positions of authority in the Assyrian government. 3.

BT 105 from 687 records the name ia-u-da in an archive 15 miles from Nineveh.125 What is important to note is that while the biblical text describes the north- erners as being deported to particular peripheral and central areas, the Akkadian texts show that they were in the core cities of Assyria, Kalhu, Nineveh, and Dur Sharruken. Israelites were included in the Assyrian military. Tiglath-Pileser's deporta- tion from Samaria included adding 200 or fifty chariots to his army, and Sargon added 200 chariots from Samaria to his army.126 A listing of chariot commanders for the Samarian cohort, CTN III 99 ii. 16-23, contains two Yahwistic names and might even be the remnant of the northern chariotry incorporated into the Assyri- an army.127 ADD 234/ARU 523 refers to a chariot driver who was either an Israelite or a Judean.128 ABL 1009 refers to Samarians, who might be native Israelites serv- ing in the Assyrian army.129 We have clear evidence of eighth-century deportees from the Northern King- dom and the Southern Kingdom in Mesopotamia. Despite the biblical texts' silence about the Judean deportations as a result of Sennacherib's invasion(s), the south- erners were granted by the Assyrian authorities the economic and social opportu- nities to retain their Judean identity. At the same time, northerners and southerners were most likely in contact while in Mesopotamia, and they probably amalgamat- ed to a certain extent during their 200-year sojourn.130 Yet, it is as if the south- ern deportees of 701 never existed. The only deportations from the South that are preserved in biblical memory are the later ones accomplished by the Babylo- nians. V THE RETURN OF NORTHERN DEPORTEES The Babylonians deported southerners as part of their campaigns of 597 and 587-586, and in 538, Cyrus called for these southern deportees to return to their homeland. What happened to the northern deportees? Prophetic texts assume that the northern exiles will return and join with their southern brethren, and seventh- and sixth-century prophets are concerned about 125.

Jeremiah's interest in the North is demonstrated when he in- cludes the north in his preaching to Judah. The superscription to the oracle in Jeremiah 2:4 is addressed to a mixed group, including a Northern Kingdom audi- ence-whether exiled in Assyria or still living in the North or living in the South. 32 In the oracle stemming from the potter and the clay, Jeremiah refers in 18:6 to "the House of Israel." Because in the adjoining oracle Jeremiah refers to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Judah (18:11), it may be that Jeremiah is addressing the northerners in the first oracle. The Northern Tribes were to be reunited with Southern Tribes, according to prophetic texts.133 Isaiah 11:11-13 promises the redemption of Israelites from As- syria and a wide range of places.134 Jeremiah 3:18 vouches for the reuniting of Is- rael and Judah from the land of the north. Ezekiel 37:21-22 pledges that the Israelites will be gathered from their dispersion and be reestablished in a single kingdom. According to Hosea 2:2, the northerners and the southerners will join to- gether. Some prophetic material promises that the northerners were to be resettled into their own land (Jeremiah 23:8). Evidence from the sixth-century prophet Ezekiel reflects the continued ex- istence of the northerners almost 200 years after their kingdom was destroyed. At times, Ezekiel distinguishes between the two groups (4:5, 6; 9:9; 27:17; 37:15- 23) and between two groups of elders (14:1; 20:1, 3 versus "the elders of Judah," in 8:1). He addressed himself to "the entire House of Israel" (37:11; 39:25; 45:6), where he appears to be including both the northerners and the southerners. Nonprophetic texts from the early Second Temple period present the return of northern exiles. Despite the fact that Ezra 2:1 and Nehemiah 7:6 enumerate only the Judeans as returning, other verses in these books indicate otherwise. First, in Ezra 6:17, offerings are made for all twelve tribes. Second, the Nobites mentioned in Ezra 2:29 and 1 Chronicles 5:26 may have been former Reubenites deported by Tiglath-Pileser III.'35 This identification is reflected in the similarity between the names and genealogy in 1 Chronicles 5:4-8 and Ezra 10:43. Third, the returnees 131. The Israelites maintained ties with their homeland. In 2 Kings 17:28, a priest who served the Israelites is sent back from exile to serve the new settlers in the territory of the Northern Kingdom. See Avraham Malamat, "Exile," Encyclopaedia Judaica 6:1036. 132. Jack R. Lundbom suggests that the inclusivity is a result of the mention of the ancestors stretching all the way back to the Wandering in the Wilderness when all twelve tribes were in existence (Jeremiah 1-20 [Anchor Bible; Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1999], 258). Does this mean that the in- clusion of the Northern Tribes is a literary fiction? Lundbom himself does not think so, as he argues for the possibility of northerners still living in the North in his earlier comment on the verse. 133. Zechariah 11:14 is a rare verse that tells of future disunity between the northerners and southerners. 134.

Since this area was conquered by the Moabites (Isaiah 15-16; Jeremiah 48; Zepha- niah 2:8-11), it was later included in the province of Moab. Fourth, the returnees included in the lists in Ezra and Nehemiah are those from Israelite territory on the coast and Mt. Ephraim. This evidence is usually taken as reflecting Judahite con- trol during Josiah's reign, but it could reflect northerners returning. Fifth, as for Iranian surnames mentioned in Ezra and Nehemiah, because clans have thousands of descendents, their ancestors must have been from a number of generations (Ezra 2:8, 14 = Nehemiah 7:13, 19). If these names were not newly adopted after Per- sian conquest, perhaps the people holding such names were descendents of the northerners who were deported to Media by Assyria.137 Sixth, if 1 Chronicles 9:3 reflects the situation of the restoration period, then those mentioned are either de- scendents of the northern exiles to Assyria or descendents of the northern refugees to the south. Lastly, there were men who had difficulty proving their identity (Ezra 2:59). It is hard to believe that the children or grandchildren would have trouble proving descent, and it can be surmised that these were the descendents of eighth- century exiles, whether northern or southern.138 Early Second Temple texts preserve the contention that some Northerners were not exiled at all.139 2 Chronicles 30:6, for example, refers to the remnant that escaped the hands of the Assyrian kings, a remnant that appears to be different from those exiled by the Assyrians. Bustenay Oded argues that this text demon- strates that a mixed Israelite and Judean population lived in Transjordan. An Is- raelite population, composed of refugees (2 Chronicles 30:6, 10-11), lived in the Peraea, an area west of the Jordan, in what was the Northern Kingdom, after the destruction of the Northern Kingdom.140 They were descendents of a mixed Is- raelite-Judean population that did not go into exile.'14 This latter claim was first made by Benjamin Mazar, who argued that the Tobiads known from the Second Temple period were descendents of those exiled by Tiglath-Pileser III from their lands in Transjordan who later returned to their lands. He qualifies their northern origin by arguing that they were part of a Judean family that had estates in Gilead, and who, upon their return, found Israelites who had not been exiled.142 Prophe- 136.

According to some First Temple prophetic material, the northerners would remain in the Land of Israel. In Amos 9:9, the promise is made that some northerners will remain. According to Je- remiah 50:20, some of the northerners and the southerners will be purged of their sins and allowed to remain in the land. Hosea 3:5 predicts that the northerners will eventually repent. 140.

The Chronicler, a writer of the Persian period, seems to have genuine con- cern for the northerners after the destruction of the north.143 Hezekiah is described as sending messengers to the North as far as the tribe of Zebulon to invite the Is- raelites to join in the celebration of Passover (2 Chronicles 30:5, 11). The realm of Josiah's reform activities are expanded from Bethel and the cities of Samaria men- tioned in Kings (2 Kings 23:15-20) to Menasseh, Ephraim, and Naphtali in Chron- icles (2 Chronicles 34:6). When Josiah requests aid from the prophetess Huldah, the Chronicler has him include the North (2 Chronicles 34:21 versus 2 Kings 22:13), and his actions encompass the North (2 Chronicles 34:33). No blanket condemnation of the North is found in Chronicles. Some north- erners receive positive references, even in the days of the division of the king- dom (2 Chronicles 11:16-17). Northerners entered into the covenant initiated by the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem to seek the Lord during the reign of Asa (2 Chronicles 15:9-15). Hezekiah explicitly includes those from Ephraim, Menasseh, Issachar, and Zebulon in his prayer for pardon for those not ritually fit to celebrate the feast in its proper timing (2 Chronicles 30:18). The northerners living in the south as well as visitors are mentioned as participating in the celebration (2 Chronicles 31:25). After the celebration concluded, the destruction of high places and altars ex- tended to Ephraim and Menasseh (2 Chronicles 31:1). The story of Josiah's reform specifically states Menasseh and Ephraim and all the remnant of Israel contributed the money necessary to repair the Temple (2 Chronicles 34:9 v. 2 Kings 22:4). The Chronicler shows positive feelings toward the North and shows interest in the North. This may reflect a Judean's interest in redeeming the past of his acquaintances of northern descent or perhaps even the Chronicler's own descent from the north. Prophetic texts of the eighth, seventh, and sixth centuries BCE promise that the northerners will return from exile. Prophetic texts from the sixth century demonstrate that a distinct community of northerners still existed in exile. Some texts dating from the period of the restoration assume that descendents of the de- portees from the North returned from exile, and others presume that other de- scendents of the North were still living in their homeland. VI. THE NORTHERN TRIBES BECOME LOST Throughout the Second Temple period, the assumption was that the north- ern tribes still existed. Yet right after the end of the Second Temple period, we hear the first faint echoes of lost tribes. A first century apocalyptic work, IV Ezra, refers to the nine tribes of the North existing in a faraway land (IV Ezra 13:39-47).144 They had on their own H. L.

The tribes are no longer sinners deserving of exile, but chastened and repentant, loyal to the commandments they had not kept in their own land, and waiting for redemption. Josephus includes two elements that would later be combined into the motif of the Lost Tribes, the multitudinous number of the northern tribes and the sabbati- cal river, yet without the northern tribes being unreachable. Josephus includes material based on biblical material: Hezekiah's invitation to the northerners to par- ticipate in the Feast of Unleavened Bread (2 Chronicles 30:11, 18; Antiquities, ix, 263-67), and the northern tribes' deportation to Media and Persia by Shalmaneser (2 Kings 17:6; Antiquities, ix, 277-82). But then Josephus explains the existence of two populations of Jews, one under Roman rule and the other under Parthian rule, by telling that the Babylonian Jews returned with Ezra while only some of the Jews in Media returned at that time (Antiquities, xi, 131-33). He describes the Jews "be- yond the Euphrates" as numbering countless multitudes. The description "beyond the Euphrates" would include Jews in Babylonia and, therefore, would imply that some Babylonian Jews remained or that some Jews in Media moved. This impreci- sion makes it appear that Josephus is conflating two explanations for the two popu- lations: the argument that only part of the Jews in Media returned would explain why many Jews still live there, and the story of the return would explain the existence of Jews in the Land of Israel. In either case, Josephus assumes that the population of Jews "beyond the Euphrates" consists of the descendents of the northerners. The other element that Josephus recounts is the sabbatical river. In the Jew- ish War, Josephus has to fill in the long gap in the historical narrative between the fall of Jerusalem and the siege of Masada.'46 He depicts an empire whose every part is in turmoil (Jewish War, vii, 79) and, therefore, describes a series of revolts and attacks, showing Roman rule challenged from within and without. Titus's tri- umphant march back to Rome symbolizes the restoration of the empire's integrity under the rule of the Flavian dynasty. Along the way, Titus preserves the privileges of the Jews of Antioch, an episode more germane to Josephus's focus on Jewish history, and passes by the sabbatical river. Josephus describes it flowing between Arka, a town at the northern end of the Lebanon mountains, and Raphanea, a town in northern Syria. This river flows on the Sabbath, leading non-Jews to designate it the Sabbatical river, after the famous Jewish practice. It is ironic for the river that flows on the Sabbath to be called a sabbatical river because it violates Sabbath rest. Ezra (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1990), 404. There were nine tribes in the north: Reuben, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Ephraim, Menasseh (split into two parts); and three in the south: Judah, Benjamin, and Simon. The Levites occupied an ambiguous position as a tribe. 145. W A. Wright suggested that the land's name, Arzareth, is derived from the Hebrew of Deuteronomy 29:28, n-nt y'K ("Note on the 'Arzareth,'" The Journal ofPhilology 3 [1871]: 113-14). 146.

Pliny cites the river that does not flow on the Sabbath in the section on bodies of water with unusual characteristics (Natural History, XXXI, 24). Pliny locates the river in Judea, and it seems natural that the location of a riv- er that rests on the Sabbath is in the homeland of the Jews, who rest on the Sab- bath. By contrast, Josephus places the mysterious river outside of Judea in Syria. Pliny inserts the Sabbatyon River in his discussion of bodies of water with marvelous characteristics. In this particular section of Book 37 of his Natural His- tory, Pliny has described bodies of water in which every object sinks followed by bodies of water in which every object floats. (Pliny fails to mention the Dead Sea.) He then described a body of water that moves while retaining its fish. These fish foretell the future for those who offer them food by either snapping it up or knock- ing it away with their tails. Pliny continues with a description of other prophetic waters, including one whose dry spells are an evil portent for visitors. It is at this point that Pliny parenthetically mentions a stream in Judea that dries up every Sab- bath, another body of water with dry spells but without ominous powers. Because one of the (in)famous characteristics of Jews in antiquity was their observance of the Sabbath, it would be natural for such a river to be located in the homeland of the Jews.147 Pliny apparently never visited Judea: his public service was in the western part of the Roman empire.148 His lack of familiarity with Judea caused him to err in describing the area near the home of the Essenes in his topographi- cal survey of Judea: he writes that there are palm trees in the vicinity, a descrip- tion more apt for Jericho than Qumran (Natural History V, 73). Although in his huge and unwieldy work Pliny does lapse in credulity from time to time, in gen- eral, he soberly amasses practical data.149 In contrast, Josephus's location of the river outside of Judea and predominantly Jewish territory may be a consequence of his knowledge of the actual terrain of Judea-he knows of no such river in Judea and, therefore, cannot locate it where it does not exist. Josephus's river also differs from Pliny's river in that Josephus recounts that the river flows only on the Sabbath. The legendary stream clearly has a relation- ship with the Sabbath, but whether it rests or flows on the Sabbath has not yet been 147.

Collins argues that Pliny the Elder was probably in Judea with Vespasian, Anchor Bible Dictionary 2:621. Accompanying Vespasian would account for Pliny's familiarity with Judea. However, Pliny includes descriptions of much of the known world, including the Parthian empire and India, far more than he could have possibly visited personally, and the fact that a particular area was included in his work cannot be evidence that he had personal knowledge of the area. 149.

It is as if there is a rumor about a river with a bizarre characteristic, vague- ly reminiscent of Jewish behavior. It is important to note that this river has noth- ing to do with the Lost Tribes.'5o Other sources contemporary to these assume the existence of the twelve tribes living together, without northern tribes in a faraway land.15' These elements will be joined together later in Jewish texts that speak of a number of places to where the northerners were exiled and that contain a variety of views about whether the northerners will be redeemed or not and how.'52 The variety within these texts and even within a single text is salient. The northerners are portrayed as living in an identifiable site in Syria'53 or in mysterious sites, be- yond the sabbath river or hidden under a cloud (e.g., Y. Sanhedrin, 10:6, 29c). They are depicted as never being worthy of redemption or as certainly worthy of re- demption.154 Collective amnesia enabled Jews to forget their mixed northern and south- ern ancestry and forge an image of punished and chastened northern tribes, now piously waiting to rejoin their brethren. The process of the creation of the motif of the Lost Tribes started in the biblical period. The only word about the fate of the northerners in the Deuteronomistic History is that they were exiled. That any northerner at all remained in the North or sought refuge in the South was passed over in silence. That any southerner was deported by the Assyrians was disregard- ed. The paradigm was absolute: the northern kingdom destroyed and the north- erners deported by the Assyrians as a result of apostasy, and the southern kingdom destroyed and the southerners deported by the Babylonians because of apostasy. Northerners who were not deported were excluded, and southerners who stayed in their homeland after the Babylonian deportations were eclipsed. 155Those north- erners and southerners who did not fit the pattern did not merit mention. 150. The name of the river Gozan may have inspired speculation about the whereabouts of the Ten Tribes. The word 1~ may be associated with two roots in Aramaic, Tna and Yu. The root na in Ara- maic signifies "to go across," (Michael Sokoloff, A Dictionary ofJewish Palestinian Aramaic [Ramat- Gan: Bar-Ilan University Press, 1990], 122) and it is to be speculated that this river is the one that the northern tribes crossed over. The root nm means "to cut off," (Sokoloff, 125), and perhaps this meaning led to the idea that the river somehow cut the tribes off from the Judeans in a permanent way. The con- nection with the sabbatical river appears secondary: a river that rests on the sabbath but is impassable the other days of the week explains why the tribes do not return. 151.

CONCLUSION Ronald Hendel avers that "Cultural memories tend to be a mixture of his- torical truth and fiction, composed of 'authentic' historical details, folklore motifs, ethnic self-fashioning, ideological claims, and narrative imagination."156 Because memory is recalled more than it is preserved, because we look back into the past rather than establish the shape of an event exactly as it happened, we may see the past in terms of the present, not on its own terms. The past is assimilated into a conceptual framework that may be far different from its actual contours.157 What is remembered is not necessarily what happened. History can be at odds with memory.158 The transformation of the tribes of the Northern Kingdom into the "Ten Lost Tribes" occurred because cultural memory is selective and interpretive. The motif of the "Ten Lost Tribes" once gave comfort to medieval Jews by painting a picture of numerous battalions of well-armed Israelites living in a paradise, an Eden where no insects existed and no child died in the lifetime of a parent, and who were wait- ing to sweep forward and save their fellow Jews from oppression. Today's Jews, anxious over population numbers, find lost cousins in the oddest places. True it is that the Assyrians deported northerners to faraway lands, where their descendants lived for hundreds of years. But, in fact, many of the inhabitants of the Northern Kingdom were able to stay in their homeland or seek refuge in the Southern Kingdom. Those deported to Assyria were joined two decades later by deportees from the South. The expectations were that one day the northerners would return, and the texts from the early Second Temple period indicate that some of the descendents of the northern deportees did, joining other northerners who never departed. In biblical memory, however, the reality was transfigured. All northerners were envisioned as deportees, and any southerners deported by any power other than Babylonia were ignored. The mixing of the two populations, whether in the Land of Israel or in Mesopotamia, was passed over in silence, and the creation of the motif of the Lost Tribes commenced.
