<plain_text><page sequence="1">Robert Brody. Le-Toldot Nusah ha-She'iltot [The Textual History of the She'iltot]. New York and Jerusalem: American Academy for Jewish Research, 1991. xix, 203 pp. The She'iltot is a collection of halakhic homilies arranged in the order of the weekly Torah readings of the annual cycle. The collection, attributed to the eighth-century Rabbi Ahai of Shabha, is the earliest rabbinic work subsequent to the Talmud. In Robert Brody's words, it is "the first post-Talmudic link in the mainstream of rabbinic literature" (p. vii). That in itself makes it a work of the greatest importance for the history of rabbinic literature. She'ilta homilies were structured in a specific four-part form. The third part, which functioned as a dramatic pause, reveals the original role of the she'ilta as an oral presentation. The parts were as follows. (1) A collection of halakhic rulings on a specific subject, e.g., the Sabbath, or the prohibition of theft, or the commandment to give alms. These consist mostiy of quotations from the Talmud. (2) The raising of a halakhic question regarding the chosen subject. (3) A collection of other talmudic dicta, aggadic materials related to the subject in a more general way. (4) An answer to the question originally posed, by means of the citation of the talmudic ruling on the issue. This genre of homily has a long history. A she'ilta (without the first of the four parts) is attested in the Talmud itself, and one is attested as an original oral homily as late as the tenth century. The popular nature of the she'ilta is clear from this description. There is little in the way of original textual content, since its texts derive for the greatest part from the Talmud. Their originality lies in their arrangement, choice of materials, and relationship to the biblical reading to which they</page><page sequence="2">206 BOOK REVIEWS are attached; and it is probable that the she'ilta played an important role in popularizing talmudic rulings. Rabbi Ahai's She'iltot is a literary rendition of an originally oral genre. Though it was only occasionally useful to halakhic authorities throughout the ages, its place in the history of rabbinic literature makes it of immense interest to modem scholars, not least as a witness to the talmudic text itself and to early post-talmudic halakhic formulations to which it is witness. The first desideratum for the academic utilization of such a work is, of course, the availability of a reliable text. In the years 1960-1977, Samuel K. Mirsky published an edition of the She'iltot with notes and a critical apparatus. Mirsky worked with ten manuscripts in addition to the first edition. He did not, however, define the relationship of the manuscripts to each other. It is the stated purpose of the volume under review to fill that lacuna, an absolute necessity if the textual variants are to be at all useful in the reconstruction of an Urtext. Brody's conclusions can be summed up briefly, as he does himself in the concluding section (pp. 182-183). He shows that eight of the ten manuscripts can be divided into two groups of four each; that both of these groups derive from a common source; that a ninth manuscript and the aforementioned common source both derive from an earlier common ancestor; that a ninth-century halakhic work, the Halakhot Gedolot, and the genizah fragments of the She'iltot, are occasional witnesses to the text independent of the common ancestor of the nine manuscripts; that the first edition, along with a tenth manuscript, derives from a source which was eclectic in nature and cannot be used as an independent witness to the Urtext. But to arrive at these conclusions Brody undertakes a long and arduous labor. After a brief summary of the principles of the stemmatic analysis of manuscript versions, he embarks on a detailed listing of common errors and idiosyncratic formulations common to groups of manuscripts in order to demonstrate their common ancestry or, alternatively, their independence. The procedure is then reapplied to successive manuscripts and to other witnesses to the text in order to integrate them into the picture. When necessary he explains why he considers a certain formulation to be an error. While Mirsky's edition is the foundation for Brody's work, he consults the manuscripts themselves throughout, and in fact devotes an appendix to an appraisal of Mirsky's apparatus. The great bulk of the text of Brody's book is dedicated to this kind of</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 207 minute, painstaking analysis. This is the kitchen work of textual criticism, and it provides a firm foundation for further research of a broader nature in the She'iltot. We owe a debt of gratitude to Brody for laying this groundwork. In the course of his discussion, Brody introduces material of more general interest regarding the She 'iltot, though it is clearly subservient to the technical analysis and does not constitute the original part of the work. The book contains an English foreword that describes the She 'iltot, the problematics of its study, and the intention of the present volume. Brody indicates in a number of places that he is engaged in subsequent work on the She'iltot which will utilize the foundation laid down in this research. If he applies the kind of careful study in evidence here to broader issues regarding the She'iltot, the student of rabbinics will have a good deal to learn from him.
