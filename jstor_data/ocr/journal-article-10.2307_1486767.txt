The introduction by the editors of the volume consists of a brief sketch of Goldberg's life and a summary of his academic accomplishments. The present worldwide recognition of German Judaic scholarship is substantially the result of Goldberg's creative and seminal thinking. In the 1960s, Judaic</page><page sequence="2">382 BOOK REVIEWS Studies in Germany was revived with the creation of several departments of Judaic Studies. Goldberg, in particular, was the driving force behind the high academic standards and the revolutionary methodological innovations in respect to the analysis of rabbinic texts. Some of the articles (nos. 7, 11, 14) were obviously addressed to a gentile audience that needed to be educated in respect to Judaism (p. 148); other essays were scholarly lectures and oral presentations to students of Christian theology (nos. 9, 13, 15, 16, 18). In reading these eclectic essays, one is able recognize an enormous development in the sophistication of Goldberg's insights, from descriptions and explanations of Judaica to concise analyses of rabbinic and early mystical texts. Several of the essays changed the course of German Judaic Studies and inspired other scholars to undertake serious research in previously uncharted territories. In particular, no. 4 laid the foundation for a long overdue edition of the Hekhalot texts by Peter Schiifer and his co-workers. Goldberg's keen awareness of methods in other disciplines, such as modem linguistics and Russian formalism,' in all likelihood resulted from his earlier training in Egyptology. He was able to embrace a new disci- pline, modem linguistics, in his explorations of the functional forms of rabbinic texts. Linguistic analysis underlies his methodological studies of the functional form of midrash and the discourse analysis of talmudic texts. Several terms in Goldberg's metalinguistic vocabulary-like any ex- plorer he had to first create the language with which he described the linguistic and formal traits unique to rabbinic midrash-are directly adapted from linguistics; among these terms are "synchronic,"2 "morphological,"3 "emic,"4 "syntagma,"' "formalism,"6 and "metacommunicative," as used in 1.

However, as innovative as he was, Goldberg was acutely aware of the experimental nature of his methods; in his humble way he sometimes described his brilliant explorations as merely "guesswork" (p. 4). Another influence was the terminology utilized by the circle of students at Brown University under the guidance of Jacob Neusner, as is evidenced by Goldberg's term formanalytisch, which was used widely by Jacob Neusner himself in his form-analytical studies of rabbinic literature.8 Goldberg's formula for a metalinguistic midrashic sentence posits that a midrashic operation is applied to a lemma from Scripture which then results in a dictum (e.g., see p. 80). Nevertheless, there are inherent problems in such a strict formalization process. An abstract formula for midrash as developed by Goldberg does not necessarily apply only to a midrashic sentence but to any hermeneutical approach to texts. Goldberg counters this contention by claiming that rabbinic texts are without context, ahistorical, and display a unique type of discourse (see no. 20);9 thus, the "form" discovered by Goldberg has its function only in rabbinic texts. In a brilliant continuation of his method (no. 6) Goldberg analyzed the text known as Re'uyot Yehezke 'el. In this long essay, published for the first time in this book, he criticizes Halperin's work'0 and then proceeds to translate and annotate this difficult text. The culmination of the essay is a form-analytic description of the text which leads to the conclusion that it is not a "mystical midrash" but a work in a genre of its own, consisting of an exegetical midrash and a description of heaven by a prophet, and not by a mystic. Since Re 'uyot Yehezke 'el is its own unique type of text, it deviates from the Hekhalot literature and apocalyptic forms (p. 147). Some of the essays are especially noteworthy and can be summarized as follows: a lecture on the ma 'aseh merkawah as a functional form in early mysticism is traced in no. 1; the importance of the Sinaitic revelation in 7. See, for example, U. Maas, Pragmatik und Sprachliches Handeln (Frankfurt a. M.: Athenaeum, 1972). 8. For example, J.

The essays on form analysis found in this collection served as a catalyst that transforms the study of the rabbinic literature of antiquity. It is convenient for scholars and students of rabbinics to have these essays in one volume, and any serious Judaica research library should have this book in its collection.'2 Rivka B.
