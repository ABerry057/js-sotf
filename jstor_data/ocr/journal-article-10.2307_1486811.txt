<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael Edward Stone. Fourth Ezra: A Commentary on the Book of Fourth Ezra. Hermeneia-A Critical and Historical Commentary on the Bible. Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1990. xxii, 496 pp. Since he wrote his Ph.D. dissertation in 1965 on 4 Ezra's eschatology, Michael Stone has devoted much of his scholarly research to understanding Jewish apocalyptic in general and 4 Ezra in particular. This superb com- mentary represents the mature expression of the results of that research. 4 Ezra comprises chapters 3-14 of a composite work that circulated under the name 2 Esdras. It is bounded by two other separate, and probably Christian, works, 5 Ezra (chaps. 1-2) and 6 Ezra (chaps. 15-16). This apoc- alypse is beset with difficulties, both textual and interpretive. It was most likely written in Hebrew and translated into Greek, but neither the original nor the Greek text is extant. The preserved versions divide into two primary branches, one represented by the Latin and Syriac, the other primarily by the Georgian, Ethiopic, and Coptic. Other versions, notably the Armenian, on which Stone has worked extensively, display even more convoluted tex- tual histories. For this translation, Stone generally has followed the transla- tion found in the Revised Standard Version of the Bible except in those places where, in his judgment, another reading from the ancient versions is better-a situation that arises with relative frequency. Specifically, Stone gives greater consideration to the Ethiopic and Georgian readings than did the editors of the RSV. All of the versional readings are set out in detailed textual notes that accompany the translation. Stone's understanding of the book revolves around several key issues of interpretation, and I will concentrate on the overall problems rather than on minor details, since Stone's approach to these issues sets the tone for his commentary. Three problems predominate in this book: (1) the literary</page><page sequence="2">130 BOOK REVIEWS unity of 4 Ezra, (2) the structure of the book, and (3) the religious experience of its writer. Concerning literary unity, Stone maintains that 4 Ezra is the work of a single person who crafted a tightly structured and carefully thought out work. His structural analyses demonstrate that such elements as the seer's posture and location while receiving his visions, whether or not the seer eats, and the time-frames in which the visions take place reveal a deliberate plan in the book. These smaller elements combined with the larger seven-vision structure of the work reveal an author of great skill. Although Stone rejects older source-critical theories that give the impression that 4 Ezra was a scis- sors-and-paste job, he demonstrates that the author used source materials of an extensive literary sort. These include biblical texts, most notably Dan- iel, to which the author refers in 12:11, and other sources that were incorpor- ated into the visions, such as the vision of the man in chapter 13 and possibly the mourning woman in chapters 9-10. Other preexisting literary forms, such as the rib, also find their way into this work. Yet as Stone remarks, "These sources are made integral parts of the book and serve the overall literary and conceptual goals of the author" (p. 22). Yet 4 Ezra does contain what appear to be inconsistencies, especially in its eschatology, that have been the subject of various explanations. A pri- mary example is the use of the term "end" in the book. The term, when used in a technical sense in 4 Ezra, seems to refer to different places on the escha- tological time-line. In order to resolve the perceived inconsistency and inco- herence in 4 Ezra's eschatological outlook, R. Kabisch, Das vierte Buch Esra auf seine Quellen untersucht (G6ttingen, 1889), and later J. Keulers, "Die eschatologische Lehre des vierten Esrabuches," Biblische Studien 20, nos. 2-3 (1922): 1-240, argued that the author used two competing eschatolo- gies, one nationalistic and this-worldly, and one universal and otherworld- ly. Stone demonstrates that the eschatological thought of the author is neither inconsistent nor incoherent by showing that the "end" does not de- note a specific eschatological event, but means "the decisive point in the eschatological scheme" (p. 104). The author did not have two contrasting, closed eschatological systems, but two sets of "associational complexes," one that dealt with the messiah and his kingdom and the other with a judg- ment day. The context or argument determined which set of ideas became operative. The structure of 4 Ezra and the religious experience of the author are</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 131 intimately connected. Stone works with a structural analysis that divides the book into seven visions. Visions 1-3 involve disputes with an angel; vision 4 relates Ezra's encounter with the mourning woman who is transformed into Jerusalem; visions 5 and 6 are eschatological dream visions; vision 7 finds Ezra in the position of second Moses as he receives the revelation of the Torah by God. All of these visions are joined together by strong structural connections, as Stone shows in detail throughout his verse-by-verse com- mentary. The pivotal vision is the fourth, which has structural ties to the preceding three visions and to the three that follow. Vision 4 is not only a key for Stone to understanding many of the struc- tural aspects of 4 Ezra, it also becomes central as a mechanism for under- standing its author. Stone sees in the comforting of the mourning woman Ezra's internalization of the answers to the dilemmas posed by him to God in the first three visions. In effect, in vision 4 Ezra adopts the role that the angel played in visions 1-3. Further still, Stone contends that Ezra's reac- tion to the transformation of the woman into Jerusalem-physical disorien- tation, loss of consciousness, extreme fright-reflects an actual religious experience on the part of the author. As Stone remarks in the introduction (p. 32), and as his verse-by-verse commentary bears out, "The key to the understanding of the fourth vision is that it is a description of a major reli- gious experience, a conversion. This perception makes the sudden shift in Ezra's expressed positions comprehensible." Thus, for Stone, what underlies not only Ezra's sudden acceptance of the answers that he had previously rejected, but all of the theological issues raised by the book as well as the structural movement from the earlier disputations to the later dream visions and revelation, is a transforming religious experience that the author of 4 Ezra attempts to communicate pseudepigraphically. Stone's assessment of this book thus raises an important question for the study of Jewish and Christian apocalypses. Are there real religious experiences/visions reflected in the conventionalities used in this literature? In the case of 4 Ezra, Stone replies with a convincing yes. Many other issues that cannot be examined in the present review, such as the history of scholarship on 4 Ezra and the relationship between 4 Ezra and 2 Apocalypse of Baruch, are also treated by Stone. He explores each in detail and with great skill. As the first volume in the Hermeneia series which is devoted to the nonbiblical Jewish literature of the Greek and Roman pe- riods, this commentary sets an excellent standard for future volumes.
