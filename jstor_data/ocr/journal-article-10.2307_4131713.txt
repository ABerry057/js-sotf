<plain_text><page sequence="1">AJS Review Ora Wiskind-Elper. Tradition and Fantasy in the Tales ofReb Nahman ofBratslav. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1998. viii, 310 pp. Few critical terms in use over the past two decades have been so abused and hence rendered almost meaningless as "postmodern." And yet the term can be used to advantage to describe a period, its critical suppositions, and its inherent dispo- sitions. It does signify the blurring of categories and styles, the shifting of identi- ties, the often self-conscious invasion of the objective by the subjective. When the author of a serious scholarly study of a complex, seminal religious figure-a ma- jor influence and icon in modern Jewish narrative art like Reb Nahman of Brat- slav (1772-1810)-designates herself a postmodern and conducts her investiga- tion as a postmodernist scholar, we cannot ignore this hermeneutic stance. Happily, Ora Wiskind-Elper takes her study of the texts seriously, is acutely self-conscious about her critical moves, and presents intelligent and sensitive read- ings of the thirteen canonical Bratslav tales plus the often dazzling homiletic pas- sages of Likkutei Mohoran and the more biographical, though often jumbled, peri- copes of HIayyei Moharan. She has profited from an intense study of Joseph Dan's work on the Hasidic tale seen as a discrete literary genre (1975) and Arthur Green's fundamental psychological study, Tormented Master (1981), both of which had themselves benefited from the work of Joseph Weiss (1972) and Mendel Piekarz (1974), products of the Jerusalem scholars Gershom Scholem and Isaiah Tishby. Her own study builds on these and others, such as Liebes, Elstein, Haidenberg, Oron, and Roskies, and thus culminates the achievements of a generation of solid research into the nature of these enigmatic tales. On this foundation of scholarly research, Wiskind-Elper erects a hermeneu- tic structure that exploits both her reading in German Romantic literature, much of which was contemporary with the composition and early dissemination of the Bratslav tales during the first two decades of the nineteenth century (chap. 3), and, more important perhaps, her exploration of literary theory, particularly that which deals with the realm of the fantastic and uncanny, where Todorov and Freud fig- ure significantly. Despite her obvious erudition, Wiskind-Elper is motivated by a keen cu- riosity about the enigmatic nature of these tales and by her own patent empathy with the creative personality of Reb Nahman, as he dramatizes in narrative form his vacillation between spiritual despair and ecstatic fantasy. She describes the growth of her interest in these tales, from her "first unpremeditated encounter" to a perceptive wonderment about their bizarre tone: As a postmodern reader and willing accomplice to all flights of an author's imagination, the anomalies and paradoxes the tales presented were compelling though abstruse. The complete lack in the tales of any indication their land- scape was a Jewish world was, on second thought, somewhat striking as the "hero" of traditional Hasidic tales is usually the rebbe himself, and its "mes- sage" the teaching embodied in the way he lived his life. . . . Here, in contrast, the zaddik and storyteller, never mentioned by name, seemed to exert an un- canny presence-not as subject but as creator (p. 1). 372</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews It is the figure of the creator of tales that intrigues her; it evokes her interest in artis- tic creativity in the Romantic period and, more important, in the literary products of the world of fantasy. Her description of the specific nature of Reb Nahman's lit- erary creativity is emblematic. The utter unconservative self-referentiality of Reb Nahman's tales becomes in- creasingly apparent with further reading, rereading, and the exploration of his wider oeuvre and commentary on it. The "self" referred to, of course, in the tales Reb Nahman told takes diverse forms. It is metahistorical, identifying with traditional heroes cloaked in legend; it is reflected in alter egos, charac- ters that people the tales; it is even a surreal empathy with the very symbols, metaphors, and allegories of Jewish tradition transformed in the narrative (p. 2). This focus explains her avoidance of historical inquiry in the first and third chap- ters of the book. In the first chapter, which deals with Reb Nahman's concept of himself as zaddik, his role within the burgeoning world of Hasidism in its forma- tive early generations, she makes less use than one would expect of Arthur Green's psychological portrait of Reb Nahman, his actual life and many personal disap- pointments regarding, for instance, his messiahship. Clearly, what interests Wiskind- Elper is not the actual Reb Nahman as reconstructed by Green, but the figure of the creator of these wondrous stories as it emerges from the texts or from ancillary texts like Likkutei Moharan dealing with the same motifs. One feels that a con- frontation with the figure that Green portrays would distract her from her goal: an understanding of the tales and of their creator, whose voice is so central to the tales and their import. In Chapter Three, "The Romantic Drama," for instance, Wiskind-Elper treats Romanticism at some length and several times cites the fascinating contempo- raneity of the Bratslav tales and such writers as E. T. A. Hoffmann, but she refrains from any speculation regarding the provenance of the Bratslav tales or the often striking similarity between their themes and those of the Romantics. The histori- cal setting and the folkloristic motifs that interest Yoav Elstein do not impress her. These lacunae in her treatment of the tales are cited merely to situate her focus within a variety of possible areas of investigation. In her final, fourth chapter, Wiskind-Elper fuses two pairs of possibly op- posing tendencies. First is the rich intertextual allusiveness of the tales and the in- tense, often fantastic figurative language conveyed in a very personal voice. This narrative approach implies that "this revolutionary notion, that the process of spir- itual enlightenment is necessarily effected, not by philosophical arguments, but by fiction born of the imagination-this notion is the foundation stone of Reb Nah- man's entire oeuvre" (p. 220). Second is the challenge "to strike a balance between solid scholarly work, with the documentation and implicit dialogue with contemporary research it re- quires, and personal, honest engagement with the tales, their author, and the spir- itual and religious matrix that gave birth to them" (p. 7). Note some of her sub- headings: "Perception and Deception: Transmutation of Reality Within the Tale," "Blurring of Boundaries, Shifting Identities." 373</page><page sequence="3">AJS Review Ora Wiskind-Elper has accomplished this double fusion admirably, and yet, one can imagine objections on the part of readers who resist the blurring of bound- aries and the shifting of identities.
