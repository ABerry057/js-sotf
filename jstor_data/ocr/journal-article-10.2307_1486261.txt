<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Alan Mendelson. Secular Education in Philo of Alexandria. Cincinnati: Hebrew Union College Press, 1982. Extant rabbinic literature leaves a taste of unexplained anti-Hellenism. No one has been surprised, given the differing values of rabbinic and Greek education. Much of Greek education bred sophistication as an introduction to philosophy, while rabbinic discourse sharpened the students' moral awareness of everyday activity. It took a great scholar like Saul Lieberman to show that beneath their differing aims lay centuries of uneasy cooperation and overlapping interests. Alan Mendelson continues the exploration of this subtle area of influence by analyzing Philo's views of the Hellenistic system of education. At the outset, he points out the complexity of the issue by underlining the characteristic anti-Hellenism of many Hellenistic writers. He then shows how these ambiguities are evidenced in Philo. Greek education not only prepared a youth to take his place in adult society but became an idealized virtue, symbolizing what we would call "culture" or "refinement" or "civilization." These goals were implemented by travel and contemplation and preeminently by a basic curriculum of study in the liberal arts, or enkyklios paideia, as Philo calls them. Professor Mendelson reviews the scholarly literature on encyclical studies in order to show exactly how Philo's views corresponded with and dissented from those of his approximate contemporaries. The basic curriculum of Greek education consisted more or less of gram- mar, rhetoric and dialectic, geometry, arithmetic, music, and astronomy. The Greeks appear to have been just as ambivalent about their primary studies as we are about reading, writing, and 'rithmetic-alternately prais- ing them as a necessary propaedeutic and criticizing their tedium and simpli- city by comparison to the sublimity of philosophy and art. In contradistinction to some Greek writers, Philo seems less ambiguous in his praise of encyclical studies. It would be impossible to tell whether the motivation was purely gratitude to his Hellenistic environment for having 235</page><page sequence="2">236 BOOK REVIEWS been able to benefit culturally from the level of material fortune achieved by his family or whether it also bespeaks a recommendation that more of his countrymen try or respect the disciplines. Probably it was both, for no writer writes only for one audience or only with one set of values to communicate. Dr. Mendelson is very sound in noting the social and political context of these philosophical attitudes. Philo appears to be familiar with the gymna- sium, to have witnessed various functions there, and to praise the important educational influences of this place of rhetoric and athletics-even though it was administered through civic religious exercises and involved naked exer- cise. He must have been among the most privileged of Alexandrian Jews, those who had already achieved what many in the community sought and fought to attain: citizenship in the state. The loss of that battle for emanci- pation at the end of Philo's life was as or more keenly felt among the highest classes of the Jewish community. All of this is surely reflected in Philo's complex attitudes about encyclical studies. Dr. Mendelson is also sound in his analysis of the philosophical role which these studies played in Philo's discussion of the contemplative ascent of the soul to experience God. Primary education became the vehicle of the allegory of spritual ascent for Philo. Encyclical studies must be completely studied as a background to further knowledge before the ascent, the theo- logical tenor of the allegory, can be undertaken, just as milk and cereal must be eaten before the richer foods of adulthood can be enjoyed. Professor Mendelson might have emphasized more the value of allegory and scriptur- ally based contemplation, which marks Philo as different from other philo- sophers. In the end, of course, Philo-like Plato-puts his highest trust in philosophical contemplation which empowers the ascension of the soul (and not primary education). Unlike Plato, however, Philo sees that the study of Scripture is completely in harmony with philosophical contemplation, guid- ing it to its most sublime insights. Therefore he is more positively disposed toward grammar and other linguistic tools and, as well, toward the natural sciences, which attest to the handiwork of the Creator. Professor Mendelson has whetted the reader's appetite with his com- ments about the value of primary education among the Greeks. He might also have illustrated a bit more of the interesting ambiguity in which primary education was held, though as I have said above, these are attitudes with which we naturally resonate. It is a very learned and sensitive treatment of a subtle topic.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 237 It is also a remarkably compressed treatment. Having begun more than a decade ago as a dissertation, it has been revised down to concise insights, while losing neither the seriousness of scholarly purpose nor the essential form of a dissertation. It is a book which will interest both the specialist and the serious generalist, giving both a heightened curiosity about the complex relationships between Greek and Hebrew thought which have been obscured by the historical record.
