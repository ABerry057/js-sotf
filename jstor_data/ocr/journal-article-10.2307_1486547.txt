Eisen How to prevent the dissolution of American Judaism in an era that lacks the integral communities and vibrant religious traditions of an earlier age? To cope with these challenges, Arnold Eisen seeks guidance in the living legacy of the five books of Torah. Through personal readings of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuter- onomy, Eisen examines issues relating to the meaning and purpose of Jewish tradition, the significance of faith and covenant, the contemporary uses of ritual, a new agenda for politics in American Jewish life, and the legacies to be left to future generations.

OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS</page><page sequence="11">"Recommended Reading" The Founding Myths of Israel Nationalism, Socialism, and the Making of the Jewish State Zeev Sternhell Translated by David Maisel The well-known historian and political sci- entist Zeev Sternhell here advances a radically new interpretation of the founding of modern Israel. The founders claimed that they intend- ed to create both a landed state for the Jewish people and a socialist society. However, according to Sternhell, socialism served the leaders of the influential labor movement more as a rhetorical resource for the legitima- tion of the national project of establishing a Jewish state than as a blueprint for a just soci- ety. This is a controversial and timely book. "The key words figuring in the studies of the founding fathers until now have been improvisation, pragmatism, inventive- ness, innovation, and lack of dogmatism.... With professional competence, vigor, and a clear... style, [Sternhell] challenges this description."-Menachem Brinker, Haaretz Book Supplement Cloth $29.95 ISBN 0-691-01694-1 Due January After the Holocaust Rebuilding Jewish Lives in Postwar Germany Michael Brenner Translated by Barbara Harshav This landmark book is the first compre- hensive account of the lives of the Jews who remained in Germany immediately following the war. Gathering never-before-published eyewitness accounts from Holocaust survivors, Michael Brenner presents a remarkable history of this period. At the heart of his narrative is a series of fifteen interviews Brenner conducted with some of the most important witnesses who played an active role in the reconstruc- tion-including presidents of Jewish commu- nities, rabbis, and journalists. This is a fascinating and provocative new book. "An excellent work and necessary read- ing for anyone wishing to comprehend how jews have contributed to the rebuild- ing of Germany and their own German- jewish culture. Michael Brenner offers a fine analysis of an important historical peri- od that has been largely neglected in Jewish studies." -Jack Zipes, University of Minnesota Cloth $24.95 ISBN 0-691-02665-3 Due November New in paperback Winner of the National Jewish Book Council's Sarah H. and Julius Kushner Award Through a Speculum That Shines Vision and Imagination in Medieval Jewish Mysticism Elliot R.
