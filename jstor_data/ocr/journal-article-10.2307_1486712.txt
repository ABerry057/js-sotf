<plain_text><page sequence="1">Arie Schippers. Spanish Hebrew Poetry &amp; the Arabic Literary Tradition: Arabic Themes in Hebrew Andalusian Poetry. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1994. 345 pp. Serious scholarship on medieval Hebrew secular poetry from Spain is still very much in its infancy. With the exception of some fine work, mostly articles but including some books, by Israeli scholars (whose work, nevertheless, is mostly limited to translations and anthologies with little or no analysis), virtually no substantial investigation, especially monographs, exists. Thus, the appearance of an English-language book with the promising title of this one, by a Dutch scholar whose research is primarily on medieval Arabic poetry but who nevertheless commands an acceptable level of Hebrew, is most welcome. The introduction promises an analysis of "most" of the themes and motifs of medieval Hebrew secular verse which (supposedly) were "borrowed" from Arabic. In fact, there have been very few studies to date in any language of the motifs of Hebrew poetry, and the author admits that the same is true, to a lesser degree, with respect to Arabic. Therefore, the question obviously arises whether such an undertaking is premature, and whether it can be demonstrated that all such motifs were, in fact, "borrowed" from the Arabic (something which is not successfully demonstrated in this book). There are other errors and methodological problems. The author states</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 401 that Hebrew poetry in the style of the Arabs began in the eleventh century and "was virtually dead in the twelfth" (p. 2); when in fact it began in the tenth century and was very much still "alive" in the twelfth. The author then asserts that he is "perhaps" the first to investigate motifs in medieval Hebrew poetry at all--a totally false claim (of the numerous articles which the present reviewer has written, for example, this book mentions only one, but a few by other authors are also cited, and he has unfortunately ignored several). While belittling the important classic work of David Yellin (see p. 23), for example, he ignores S. D. Luzzatto, B. Klar, and others. The author chooses to limit his study of "Hebrew Andalusian poetry" to the four "great" poets known to every schoolchild: Samuel Ibn Naghrillah (Schippers is to be commended for the correct spelling of his name), Solomon Ibn Gabirol, Moses Ibn 'Ezra(h), and Judah ha-Levy. While this limitation is perhaps defensible, it clearly restricts the area of investigation, so that, in fact, the book does not deal with "Andalusian Hebrew poetry" but only a portion thereof. Thus the conclusions drawn are automatically limited and should be tentatively stated. Such, however, is not the case, for the conclusions include the statement that "we" cannot refrain from concluding that "the Hebrew Andalusian poets" imitated Oriental (i.e., Iraqi) poets far more than they did Andalusian Arabic poets. However, surprisingly few Andalusian Arabic poets are in fact discussed in the book, most of its references being to Iraqi or Iranian poets. Each section of the book, dealing with (in fact, a very limited number of) motifs includes discussions of these Arabic poets followed by the four "stars" of Hebrew poetry, with translations (generally correct) of lines from their poems. The cumulative effect is at times overwhelming, but the patient reader will certainly find some sound observations. There are several errors and problems in the book. One is the constant "invention" of Arabic titles for Hebrew works (e.g., pp. 1, 6, 7, 62) which only confuse the reader. In chapter 3 there are frequent references to "editions" of Hebrew works which are only Spanish translations; but where the author should refer to the Spanish (if not other) translations of poems or literary works, he does not. The same is true of translations of Arabic works, both in the footnotes and in the bibliography. Technical terms, especially Arabic ones, are translated but not defined or explained. While the translations are usually correct, in at least one case (Abti Nuwis, p. 121) both the interpretation and the translation of the poem are erroneous. Transliterations of Hebrew words and titles are often incorrect. Arguments are sometimes made, or merely asserted, with no attempt at validation and which are entirely wrong (e.g.,</page><page sequence="3">402 BOOK REVIEWS Muslims were not prohibited from drinking wine, p. 115; Hebrew poetry does not only refer to drinking in courts or palaces; in fact, it rarely does so, p. 116; Isaac al-Fasi was hardly a "grammarian," p. 250; the death of Ibn Nagrillah's brother was in 881/1041, not 441/1050, p. 247; and he ignores altogether the eulogy on the death of his brother Judah). In discussing boy-love poetry, while the author is certainly to be com- mended for at least recognizing its existence, there is too much (incorrect) emphasis on the supposed "effeminate" nature of the boys, which is totally unsupported in the Hebrew genre and only rarely in the Arabic (nor did the author apparently know of the articles-at least five!-which this reviewer has published on the subject). In sum, this book is useful in providing insights from the perspective of an Arabist on some of the motifs utilized by four of the major Hebrew poets of al-Andalus. It is a significant step on the long road yet to be traversed in researching these motifs, but the conclusions are as yet premature.
