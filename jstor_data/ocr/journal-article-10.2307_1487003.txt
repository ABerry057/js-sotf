<plain_text><page sequence="1">Eugene C. Black. The Social Politics of Anglo-Jewry, 1880-1920. Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1988. xv, 428 pp. For nearly thirty years, the historiography of modern Anglo-Jewry was dominated by Lloyd Gartner's pioneering study, The Jewish Immigrant in England, 1870-1914. Now another U.S. historian, Eugene Black, has tackled the same period-but from the opposite point of view. If Gartner looked at the period 1870-1914 from the bottom up, Black takes the point of view of the Anglo-Jewish elite as they confronted the flood of unprepos- sessing East European Jews. In so doing, Black has done an enormous ser- vice to Anglo-Jewish historiography. He has provided what will remain for many years a comprehensive guide to the personalities and the policy of Anglo-Jewry, its institutions, and the social issues which they embraced. Despite the shortcomings of this long study, of which length is one, the sheer amount of information, data, and sources will keep generations of graduate students supplied with projects. Black covers one of the most controversial periods of modern Anglo- Jewish history. Perhaps because he writes from outside the established circle of researchers, Black gives a cool, honest, and occasionally disturbing account of elite policies that earlier historians of Anglo-Jewry preferred to</page><page sequence="2">240 BOOK REVIEWS avoid or obscure. He is remarkably forthright about the practice of selecting immigrants where possible and ruthlessly moving them on when it was not. He details the numbers of those repatriated to Russia and Poland by English Jews and notes that a substantial part of the Anglo-Jewish elite were willing to embrace the Aliens Act of 1905, which left the state to do the dirty work for them. Writing with New World freshness, Black does not linger over notions of Jewish solidarity or tzedakah. Yet this tendency to applaud the pragmatism of Anglo-Jewry, and to write of it with an air of sympathetic worldliness bordering on cynicism, ultimately distorts the balance of the analysis. Black is excellent in his clear illustration of the ways in which the leading English Jews seized on every opportunity offered by the state to off-load their costly Jewish social obligations. By the 1900s, for example, local rate- payers in London were paying for 70 percent of the capital's Jewish children to be educated in schools that were, to all intents and purposes, Jewish insti- tutions. He makes telling connections between the development of Jewish philanthropic enterprises and trends in late-Victorian English society. Chief amongst these shared features were the use of philanthropic ventures to paper over the cracks in social solidarity which were opened up by the industrial revolution and residential segregation. Yet Black's willingness to deploy the notion of "social control" uncritically, and only from the point of view of the elite, vitiates his analysis of the efficacy of "social politics." The reader gets no sense of what it was like to be on the receiving end of the education or welfare provided by Anglo-Jewry. Black merely asserts that all such initiatives helped keep the immigrants in their place vis-a-vis their betters, assisted their rapid anglicization, and promoted their upward social mobility. Despite a chapter on self-help and self-assertion, the "voice of the alien" is all but silent. It is notable that Black makes little use of Yiddish sources and appears to have spurned important studies of Jewish trade unions and working-class movements. He takes a flippant view of autono- mous immigrant bodies and fails to see how movements such as the London Jewish Hospital were a vital focus for rallying immigrant energies and answering needs which native Jewry failed to understand or refused to meet. At times, this becomes a monolithic and triumphalist encomium on the soi-disant "aristocracy" of Anglo-Jewry. (They were simply very rich bankers with very new titles.) Because Black seems so enraptured with this elite, and appears to identify his perspective so closely with theirs, his narra- tive is often one-sided, complacent, and whiggish. It has the feel of an</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 241 admiring travelogue compiled by yet another American who has fallen in love with oak-paneled rooms, kedgeree, and the smell of cigar smoke on still nights in the club. Thirty years ago, Gartner arrived in town with the smell of haimishe cucumbers and fried fish from the immigrant district of Philadel- phia, where he grew up, in his nostrils-and followed the same fragrant odor to Whitechapel and Stepney. The result was a study informed by warmth and familiarity as well as critical distance. Judging from his orienta- tion, Eugene Black would appear to have sought refuge in Anglo-Jewry from the failure of the American Jewish leadership to hold the line against the unwashed. In this case romance and wishful thinking have got the better of the historian. The quality of his research is, nevertheless, most impressive. He con- tributes an innovative chapter to Jewish women's history and has not been squeamish about tackling the issue of Jewish crime. The final chapters on the external policy of Anglo-Jewry are likewise an adventurous departure. They meld together responses to the crisis of Russian Jewry, the impact of World War I, and the eruption of Zionism with internal developments and tensions between sections of Anglo-Jewry. In fact, the content of the last fifty pages is so rich and suggestive that it might have been better saved for another monograph. In the event, the two very dense chapters on foreign affairs sit uneasily with the previous exhaustive, and exhausting, examina- tion of domestic policy. With all of its failings, this is a major contribution to Jewish and Anglo-Jewish history, full of acutely observed interconnec- tions with general history, for which Black and his publisher, Blackwell, deserve a good deal of credit.
