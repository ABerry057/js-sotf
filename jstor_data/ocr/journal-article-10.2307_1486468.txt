<plain_text><page sequence="1">Marc Lee Raphael. A bba Hillel Silver: A Profile in American Judaism. Intro- duction by Rabbi Alexander M. Schindler. New York: Holmes &amp; Meier, 1989. xxxiii, 282 pp. Marc Lee Raphael's Abba Hillel Silver is an important book for students of American Jewish history, Zionism, and the Holocaust. The first full- length biography of Abba Hillel Silver (1893-1963), based on extensive, new primary research, it is richly detailed and alive to the complexities and con- troversial aspects of the Cleveland rabbi's personality as well as his wide range of interests and talents. More than half of the book focuses on Silver's activities as an indefatigable Zionist leader from 1939 to 1949. Less attention is paid to his role as a congregational rabbi, local community leader, and Jewish intellectual. General readers will probably find the book to be narrowly focused and uneven. Raphael generally fails to place Silver in the context of his times and consequently does not fully explain the larger historical significance of his remarkable career. Equally disappointing is Raphael's inattention to the inner content of Silver's personal intellectual development, an odyssey which led the Lithuanian-born activist from Ahad Ha'am's Cultural Zion- ism to the halls of the largely anti-Zionist Hebrew Union College (1911-1915) and, ultimately, to General Zionism and the championing of the cause of Jewish statehood.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 137 In his eulogistic introduction, Alexander Schindler, the president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, suggests that there was a higher unity in Silver's intellectual and religious life than is portrayed by Raphael. Essentially, he maintains that Silver sought to introduce the concepts of Amcha (peoplehood) and Shivat Zion (restoration) to Reform Judaism's "classical" understanding of Israel's biblical prophets and correctly attrib- utes to Silver a "holistic sense of Jewish life [which became] the hallmark of Reform Judaism in the postwar years" (p. xxxi). Filling in a major gap in Raphael's text, Schindler also cites Silver's historic 1935 speech before the Central Conference of American Rabbis, which helped pave the way for the adoption of the 1937 Columbus Platform and the Reform movement's re- affirmation of Jewish peoplehood. From reading this volume, it becomes clear that Silver's relationship with the Reform movement was more complex than Schindler suggests. Raphael offers one (probably) apocryphal explanation as to why the young Silver chose to study at HUC, "a bastion of anti-Zionism"-"to conquer it" (p. 10)-but also reports that, in general, Silver kept his distance from the organized Reform movement. In a letter written to a friend in 1943, Silver complained that "our Rabbinate is less informed than the average Jewish layman. ... They do not study. They do not read. They are just pom- pous loud speakers for stale platitudes" (p. 76). Regrettably, Raphael does not discuss Silver's term of office as CCAR president from 1945 to 1947. In contrast to Silver's apparent ambivalence toward the organized Reform movement, Raphael argues, his emotional and intellectual ties to Eretz Yisrael and Zionism were deeply rooted in his childhood and early education. Hebrew was spoken and studied at home as well as in school. His parents, Rabbi Moses and Dinah Silver, were Zionists and encouraged their children to organize and participate in the Dr. Herzl Zion Club. Emigrating to Palestine after their children had grown, they provided Abba Hillel Silver with an intense personal tie to the land of Israel which augmented his already highly nurtured ideological commitment to Zionism. It is possible that the organizing theme of Raphael's book changed as his work on it progressed. The major emphasis of the biography seems to shift from Silver's rabbinate to his Zionist activity and, finally, back to his rab- binic work. Both the subtitle and the preface suggest that Silver "saw his primary role as a ray, a rabbi" (p. xiv), a theme principally discussed in chapters 2 and 9. But, as already noted, most of the book concentrates on Silver's participation in the "furious factional fights" at the highest levels of</page><page sequence="3">138 BOOK REVIEWS American Zionist leadership and his relentless diplomatic work on behalf of Jewish statehood in Palestine. In his conclusion, Raphael maintains that Silver "was above all else a Zionist" (p. 215). Raphael also generally fails to alert his reader to the broader historio- graphical issues involved in his study of Silver. Most importantly, in discuss- ing the highly sensitive issue of American Jews and rescue efforts during the Holocaust, Raphael offers little historical perspective or analysis. He depicts Silver as skeptical about the possibilities of rescue but reports that Silver's colleague and admirer, Rabbi Leon Feuer, observed his "single-minded devotion to the task [of rescue]" (p. 92). By the end of 1943, Raphael finds that "for Silver the facts were plain; the Nazis had already murdered almost all the Jews of Europe; [and] the most appropriate response to this massive extermination was an autonomous Jewish state" (p. 97). David S. Wyman's assertion in his widely acclaimed book, The Abandonment of the Jews, that American Zionists led by Abba Hillel Silver "had misread the signs concern- ing rescue [of European Jewry, and that] substantially more was possible than they recognized" (p. 177) is totally ignored by Raphael. By contrast, his description of Silver's role in the creation of the State of Israel and in the subsequent struggle over control of the Jewish Agency is both more complete and more compelling. Following years of sharp conflict with adversaries within American Zionism, most notably Nahum Gold- mann and Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, Silver gained control of the movement at the propitious moment to serve as a midwife for the birth of the Jewish state both in the United Nations and as a Zionist lobbyist to the Truman adminis- tration. Silver's affiliation with the Republican Party and opposition to the partitioning of Palestine, Raphael adroitly points out, greatly complicated his work in Washington, D.C. The tremendous power Silver had garnered by 1948 put him at odds with Israeli leaders, especially David Ben-Gurion, who believed that "the do- mination of Zionist affairs ought to rest with those men (and a woman) who had in fact made aliyah" (p. 216). "There is little doubt," Raphael candidly remarks, "that in addition to Zionist issues, Silver himself served as a cata- lyst for much of the opposition that successfully forced him to resign. ... Different people found him arrogant, overbearing, domineering, egotistical, contemptuous, and an enemy of anyone who dared oppose him or one of his ideas" (p. 181). Thus, despite its lacunae and unevenness, Raphael's biography of Rabbi Abba Hillel Silver succeeds in portraying its subject as an autocratic, bril-</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 139 liant, and energetic leader who thrived on hardball politics, rose to inter- national fame, and then quickly fell from power to become an elder states- man and scholar. He was revered by his supporters and despised by his opponents. Above all, he was the dynamic voice of American Jewry during the most fateful hours in the modern history of the Jewish people. Raphael's book represents an important first step in the direction of understanding Abba Hillel Silver and, perhaps, will refocus scholarly attention on the important role American Jews played in the creation of the State of Israel.
