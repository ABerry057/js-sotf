Paris: Cerf, 1991. 204 pp. Jean-Christophe Attias opens this monograph with the dramatic juxtaposition of a fifteenth-century eyewitness report and a modern historiographical survey. The report indicates that, in his own Byzantine setting, Mordecai ben Eliezer Comtino (1402-1482) was a widely respected Rabbanite authority famous for vast learning in secular and religious sciences. In sharp contrast, the survey shows that Comtino quickly became and remained relatively unknown to both traditionalists and critical historians, who evinced little or no interest in him. On those rare occasions when Comtino was considered, he was tendentiously misjudged. Noting that Comtino and his unpublished Commentary on the Pentateuch typify the mass of significant historical figures who still await</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 211 a well-deserved "restoration to posterity" and the "hundreds of manuscripts which have yet to find a reader" (p. 14), Jean-Christophe Attias asks: Why has Comtino generally been misunderstood and neglected? To answer this ethically tinged question, Attias invokes the sociology of scholarship and persuasively argues that ideological considerations are to blame. Without descendants to perpetuate his honor and emulate his example, Comtino became a "victim" who suffered the posthumous misfortune of belonging to multiple peripheries and marginalized minorities. He belongs to an agenda relatively shunned by scholarship: Byzantine Jewry before it was overshadowed by the more popular mystique of Sephardic exiles and their culture. Comtino also advocated philology, scientific rationalism, and mathematical astronomy. Attias notes that these scholarly pursuits were uncongenial to an Oriental society increasingly attracted to the mysticism of Kabbalah. Moreover, Comtino was a tolerant Rabbanite who set an uncom- fortable example by following his mentor's lead in accepting "heterodox" Karaite students. Finally, he was classified, then too quickly dismissed, as merely another "epigone" whose fifteenth-century commentaries and super- commentaries characteristically showed little originality in their apparent rehashing of Maimonides and Abraham Ibn Ezra. Ideology also explains why Attias decided to correct the scholarly record. To improve contemporary Jewry's troubled relationships with its own un- specified marginal and heterodox groups, Attias urges the reader to study Comtino's rapprochement with the Karaites (p. 16). In Comtino's social tolerance and intellectual preference for rational truth, whatever its ethnic source might be, Attias also discovered an ethically admirable openness to the "Other," both Jew and non-Jew, as well as the "forgotten roots of a modernity yet to be born" (p. 171). Framed by this concluding utopian vision and the ethically tinged opening question, the monograph makes for instructive and edifying reading. It is carefully documented, rigorously argued, and informed by current trends in cultural studies. Chapter 1 reviews the scant biographical data related to Comtino, comments on his preference for Greek rather than Arabic language and culture, briefly discusses aspects of his anti-Christian polemics, and provides a useful bibliographic listing of his various works. Chapters 2 and 3 are devoted to Comtino's intellectual and social relations with Karaism, devoting especially detailed attention to his resolution of the problem of peshat where it conflicts with actual rabbinic practice (kabbalah) and to</page><page sequence="3">212 BOOK REVIEWS his mastery of the mathematical and astronomic sciences as they relate to the controversial fixing of the calendar. Here, as throughout the monograph, Attias emphasizes the social implications of intellectual debates, noting that knowledge, power, and authority are inseparable. Chapters 4 ("The Impossible Submission") and 5 ("The Impossible Sur- passing") trace Comtino's ambivalence toward Ibn Ezra. Surveying the more than 250 references to Ibn Ezra in Comtino's Commentary (p. 92, n. 3), Attias discovered that Comtino was no mere "epigone" who passively transmitted his medieval philological tradition. Chapter 4 proves that Comtino never slavishly copied Ibn Ezra even when he agreed with him. Chapter 5 explores the other side of the paradox. Even when Comtino highlighted and corrected Ibn Ezra's philological errors, he nevertheless adhered to Ibn Ezra's methods and principles. He thereby "remained something of a prisoner, not only to the rhetoric, but to the intellectual and referential universe of Ibn Ezra" (p. 119). In stressing the pedagogic activities of selection, translation, and innovation in Comtino's creative reworking and critical adaptation of Ibn Ezra, Attias honors an explicitly announced intellectual debt to the Konstanz circle of reader-response critics led by Hans Robert Jauss. Like Michael Baxandall, Stanley Fish, Wolfgang Iser, and Jauss, Attias is dissatisfied with the conventional scholarly interest in writing the history of "influence." He too stresses the "dialectical relationship between the production of the new and the re-production of the old" (p. 90, n. 1).1 The "old" and the "new" are further explored in chapter 6 ("The Dwarf and the Giants: The Argument over Authority and Exegetical Liberty"). It discusses Comtino's views regarding the creative tension between the Ancients (Qadmonim or Rishonim) and the Modems (Aharonim). This chapter also revisits the earlier analysis of Comtino's intellectual debate with the Karaites and his notion of an objective, scientific, "neutral" truth (p. 87). Based on close readings of Comtino's exegesis of pericopae in Genesis and his polemic with Shabbetai ben Malkiel Ha-Kohen, who had attacked him for criticizing Ibn Ezra's conclusions, Attias skillfully extracts two of Comtino's fundamental principles: the historicist notion of cumulative, progressive science, and the Maimonidean ideal of accepting rationally proven truths regardless of their authorial identity. 1.

In sum, this is an altogether remarkable monograph. It persuasively displays the "historical and social significance of Comtino's exegetical enterprise" (p. 147). It is an exemplar of Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi's apology for secular scholarship: Historiography ... cannot be a substitute for collective memory, nor does it show signs of creating an alternative tradition that is capable of being shared. But ... against the agents of oblivion, the shredders of documents, the assassins of memory, ... only the historian, with the austere passion for fact, proof, evidence, which are central to his vocation, can effectively stand guard.2 Kalman P.
