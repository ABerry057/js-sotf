Waltham, MA: Brandeis Uni- versity Press; Hanover, NH: University Press of New England, 2004. xix, 340 pp. Several years ago I had the good fortune to meet Iris Parush, and I asked how she, a scholar of Hebrew literature known best for her interest in canon formation, turned to the topic of women readers in Eastern Europe. She explained that it was her work on the writer and critic David Frischmann that piqued her interest in the topic. The emotional and contradictory rhetoric of this refined thinker led Parush to embark on an enormous and important research project. Reading Jewish Women: Marginality and Modernization in Nineteenth- Century Eastern European Jewish Society is the result of her work. It is a re- markable book for its scope and depth, but most of all for its perspective. One of Parush's main conclusions is that one of the unexpected consequences of Jewish women's exclusion from the traditional Jewish educational system was that they were free to pursue a secular education. Parush dubs this phenomenon "the bene- fits of marginality," as it was women's very marginality that paradoxically allowed them access to literature denied to their brothers. I would suggest that, similarly, Parush's status as a scholar of literature, and thus marginal to the major historical debates and concerns, endows her with a degree of creativity from which we all benefit. The concept of Jewish women as readers is not new. Anyone familiar with the literature of the Eastern-European Jewish past knows to expect the dual images of the pious older woman with her tsena-urena and the vibrant younger woman en- grossed in Tolstoi or Schiller. Parush's contribution is not in bringing to light new sources. Certainly her knowledge of the literature of the period is great, and she uncovered and read an impressive number of memoirs by both men and women. She also mined the Hebrew, Yiddish, and Russian language journals of the late nineteenth century, but what she really adds is a new perspective. 402</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Through sensitive and careful readings of the contemporary autobiogra- phies, Parush compares the "reading biographies" of men and women. In doing so she demonstrates that the well-known eureka moment of Jewish men on first en- countering scientific texts or maskilic autobiography did not exist for women. Jew- ish women were able to assimilate secular literature into their lives without a breach with their past. Many scholars have read these same memoirs over the years, but Parush's unique training and interest in books allowed her to pay attention to both what and how people read to reach this important insight. Parush quite correctly devotes separate chapters to the educational training and reading paths of women who read in Yiddish, European languages, and He- brew. Although many women passed from one category to another, this division allows Parush to focus on important distinctions. Thus, whereas women had to rely on men to teach them Hebrew, in quite a few cases the reverse was true for Euro- pean languages. Parush uses this finding to write at greater length on women as agents of social change. The final chapter returns to Parush's original inspiration, David Fisch- mann. Parush shows how, despite the very real pain, anxiety, and even rage of Frischmann and others over women's trespass into the sacred sphere of Hebrew, ultimately concerns over the decline of readership led to their embrace of women as both readers and writers of Hebrew literature. Parush's acute reading skills and comfort with the array of sources are particularly impressive in this essay. Parush's unique literary engagement endows the book with indisputable merit. At the same time, the nonstandard approach leads to certain difficulties. Most significant is that learning about Jewish life in Eastern Europe mainly from the maskilim can create misconceptions. Parush frequently refers to the "war be- tween the maskilim and the haredim" in a manner that is both anachronistic and overly deterministic. Although it is certainly true that traditional Jews and their de- tractors had conflicts during the nineteenth century, to speak of a war between two opposing camps is to reflect a later reality back on the 1860s. Parush does not use dates very frequently and seems to assume a commonality between the experiences of men and women born in the 1830s and the 1870s. Equally disturbing, she cred- its both the traditionalists and the progressives with a degree of cohesion and au- tonomy that they certainly did not have. She writes of rabbis barring Jews access to Hebrew grammar and of maskilim deliberately creating schools for girls with- out proper Judaic curricula as if neither of these groups operated within an educa- tional tradition and within communities with their own expectations. These misunderstandings can be distracting to the historian, but they do not detract from the overall import of the book. We have the Tauber Institute for Jewish Studies and Brandeis University to thank for bringing out this important work in English. Although the English trans- lation does not fully capture the beautiful literary quality of Parush's Hebrew style and includes the odd choices to leave both "Laaz" and "haredim" untranslated, as well as some highly idiosyncratic transliterations of names and places (e.g. Havul- son, Telshie), it remains quite readable. 403</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Without a doubt, this book is a seminal contribution to the study of East Eu- ropean Jewry. Scholars of this period, and especially historians, would be well ad- vised to consider Parush's novel approach and findings. Eliyana R.
