Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. xxxi, 369 pp. This book compares two uneasily related exile communities in early twenti- eth-century Shanghai: the Russians and the Jews. Although traders, including some Jews, had drifted down from Siberia from the mid-nineteenth century, the Russians in Shanghai, for a time the city's largest foreign community, were main- ly remnants of Admiral Kolchak's "White" army who fled Vladivostok in 1922- 23, with a rag-tag group of camp followers, aboard what remained of the former 188</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews imperial fleet. Most settled in the French Concession district and worked as small shopkeepers. The Jewish refugees from Germany and Central Europe who fol- lowed in the period 1938-41 had little in common with the Russians, some of whom regarded the Jews as commercial rivals, and many of whom were deeply in- fected by the traditional anti-Semitism of the Russian extreme right. The yoking together in this study of these two very different and mutually suspicious communities is justified by the author on the ground that they shared the character of "victim diasporas" (p. 5). The two groups did share a legal sta- tus-or non-status-of statelessness. Both exhibited many of the common col- lective traits of exile groups: tendencies to paranoia, conspiracy theorizing, polit- ical fragmentation and in-fighting, nostalgic sentimentalism about the homeland, and unrealistic expectations about a return to their previous condition. Hence the decision by some four thousand Russians to accept an invitation to move to Stal- in's Russia in 1947-48; and the repatriation at the same time of about two thou- sand Jews to Germany-the only organized group of German Jewish refugees to return after the war. But in spite of these common characteristics, the proposed ty- pology is flawed since the nature of victimhood was very different in the two cases. The Russians were, for the most part, ex-combatants and their families who had fled their country after defeat in a civil war. The Jews were civilians driven out of their homeland by racial persecution. Although the author has exploited an impressive range of printed and man- uscript materials in several languages (including Russian, Japanese, and Chinese, but not Hebrew or Yiddish), the most heavily used source is the collection of records of the Special Branch, that is, political section, of the Shanghai Municipal Police. This was the security service that operated in the International Settlement of Shanghai until 1941 under British control and from then until 1945 under Jap- anese control. Russians were among the senior officers of the force under both dis- pensations and among subordinate employees there were also a few Jews. This treasure trove of documentation, now held by the United States National Archives, includes detailed reports on social and political developments in both the Russian and the Jewish communities. Ristaino's approach is more descriptive than analytical. On the Jewish com- munity, the account given here is the best documented and generally most reliable yet published-certainly an improvement on David Kranzler's Japanese, Nazis and Jews (Hoboken, New Jersey: Ktav, 1988), which gave too much credit to the Japanese for supposedly pro-Jewish policies and accepted too readily Orthodox Jewish gripes against the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee and against non-Orthodox elements in the Jewish community. Ristaino shows greater sympathy and closer knowledge of the Russian than of the Jewish context. But she handles the tangled internecine conflicts within both communities effectively and, in general, her judgment is sound on both fronts. Dis- missing the oft-repeated notion that Japanese restriction of Jewish refugees to a so-called ghetto in 1943 was a response to purported German pressure, a myth propagated by, among others, Kranzler, she notes that this explanation probably derived from the desire of many refugees after the war to qualify for German resti- tution claims by showing that they had been victims of Nazi or Nazi-influenced 189</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews persecution. And she briskly deflates the exaggerated legend of Chiune Sugihara, the Japanese vice-consul in Kaunas, whose alleged defiance of his government in granting visas to Jewish refugees is credited by some with saving large numbers of lives. On the other hand, her speculation that Sugihara was a Soviet spy is mere- ly unsubstantiated surmise. Overall this is a valuable, intelligent, and elegantly written account of the contrasting collective experiences of these two communities in their exotic-sound- ing but in reality squalid and unwelcoming Nachtasyl.
