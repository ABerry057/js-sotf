New York: Basic Books, 2002. xvii, 462 pp. This valuable book is more than a long overdue corrective to the extant one- volume histories of American Jewry whose narratives pivot upon a familiar list of male names. Diner and Benderly offer us all the events and themes ofAmerican Jew- ish social history that we expect to find, but we see them through the actions, moti- vations, and experiences of women. And because women's experiences often have been entirely different from those of men, we learn more about the topic than can be available in the previous one-volume accounts. Although this book was written for a general audience, it reminds this reader of the more scholarly US. History as Women 's History (1995)1 for the new understandings it brings to familiar material. The authors assert that "women have had a distinctive history apart from that of Jewish men" (p. xv) and that the activities they recount are, in their view, "large- ly the work of women fulfilling women's sacred role" (p. xvii), as described in Proverbs 31:10-31, which appears in its entirety in the opening of the book. In fact, the title of this volume is taken from the Proverbs text. The great strengths of this book are its wealth of data and the engaging man- 1. U.S. History as Women's History, ed.

New chapters usually open with a dramatic episode in the life of a Jewish woman of the period to be explored, a device that both involves the reader and introduces previously little-known actors. So Jewish colonial New Amsterdam begins with an account of a lawsuit brought by Rycke Nunes against Asser Leveen over boat fare. A thorough discussion of the complexities of colo- nial and early nineteenth-century Jewish life in North America begins with Re- becca Samuels' comment that although her family in Petersberg, Virginia enjoyed a degree of freedom and success unimaginable to her kinfolk in Germany, "the way we live here is no life at all" (p. 19). The Samuels family soon relocated to Charles- ton and its 300-strong Jewish community. Discussions of the subtle interaction of social forces, historical events, and basic Jewish religious experiences in this and other chapters make the volume much more than a "telephone book" style introduction to American Jewish women. For example, we learn quite a lot about the degree to which nineteenth-century families were scattered around the country, the miles women traveled to find suitable hus- bands, and that in these circumstances, many immigrant women, particularly after 1820, "quickly adopted the American custom of choosing their own mates" (p. 90). In some of these cases, intermarriages brought new young people into the Jewish fold; in other cases, they left. Throughout the nineteenth century, Jewish women were enter- prising. Around the country, from New Jersey to California, women ran boarding- houses, general and clothing stores, and stationery, millinery, butcher, and dressmak- ing shops. Many of these concerns were family-owned businesses in which husbands traveled to customers, either peddling or visiting other businesses, while women shared in the toil of creating the product, running the shop, and tending the ledger. Twentieth-century women's lives were more varied. Francis Y. Slanger, for example, was an army nurse who landed with American soldiers at Normandy and wrote about the event for Stars and Stripes before losing her life there. An army hospital ship was named for her. While this book introduces us to many American Jewish women, it provides important general data in which to frame that knowl- edge. Jewish men and women had begun to reach white-collar occupations by the 1920s, working as clerks, bookkeepers, teachers, and business owners, and a decade later "a high school diploma was the minimum expected of youngsters from respectable Jewish families" (p. 281). By 1968, Jewish communities outside the northeast grew, in some cases tripling. Through all these twentieth-century travels and changes, Jewish women's service organizations provided communal and in- tergenerational bonds that united women in communities large and small around the country. Late in the century, feminism transformed many of those organiza- tions, as it did Jewish women's religious opportunities. The title may lead a reader to expect that this is a volume primarily ad- dressing Jewish women's religious lives. Yet, the book is primarily a social histo- ry of American Jewish women. This volume attempts to tell a complex story in a succinct and compelling manner and achieves much of its goal. Dianne Ashton Rowan University Glassboro, New Jersey 198</page></plain_text>
