<plain_text><page sequence="1">INTERCITY RELATIONS IN ROMAN PALESTINE: THE CASE OF SEPPHORIS AND TIBERIAS by STUART S. MILLER Sepphoris and Tiberias were the most important administrative and rab- binic centers of Roman Galilee. The two cities had much in common: both were associated with Herod Antipas, who rebuilt Sepphoris sometime after a futile revolt in 4 B.C.E. and still later founded Tiberias;' both had jurisdic- tion over the bank and archives of Galilee at various times during the first century;2 both had pro-Roman factions in the First Revolt, though that of The writer expresses his gratitude to the University of Connecticut for a Summer Faculty Fellowship to complete this work, an earlier version of which was presented under the title "From Tiberias to Sepphoris.. ." at the 1984 Annual Meeting of the Society of Biblical Litera- ture.

MILLER Sepphoris was more influential;3 both maintained Hellenistic institutions and minted coins;4 both were connected by the major road built by Hadrian from Acco to the Sea of Galilee;5 both would eventually become home to the Sanhedrin and the patriarchal house;6 both maintained communities of priests associated with a particular mishmar (priestly course),7 and finally, both attracted many prominent tannaim and amoraim who established noted academies.8 Despite these similarities-or perhaps because of them-it has often been contended that, from the first century on, Sepphoris and Tiberias vied for both political and rabbinic supremacy over Galilee.9 That the two cities were rivals at the outset of the First Revolt is apparent from a report of Josephus in Life 37-38. The historian relates that Justus of Tiberias incited his fellow Tiberians to join the revolt against Rome. Justus exhorted the Tiberians by pointing out that Nero had given jurisdiction over their city to Agrippa and had made Sepphoris the capital of Galilee in its stead. The passage reads: 3.

But now he said that they had been unfortunate in having been given by Nero as a present to Agrippa the younger. For Sepphoris had at once become the capital [arxai] of Galilee when it submitted to the Romans, and their [the Tiberians'] royal bank and archives were dissolved.'0 Justus' argument clearly discloses a dispute between Sepphoris and Tiberias over which city deserved to be the capital of Galilee.1' Many writers interested in the later history of these cities regard this dispute as the begin- ning of a rivalry which was to last for centuries. Thus M. Goodman refers to the "constant rivalry" which existed between provincial cities and as an example notes that Tiberias was "traditionally opposed to Sepphoris and Hippos."l'2 L. Levine states in reference to the Josephus passage, "It is hard to imagine that such tensions could completely disappear under the later empire."'3 Levine also speaks of the "antagonism between these two large municipal centers" and attempts to find indications of it in rabbinic sources.'4 Finally, R. Kimelman addresses the question of Tiberias' rise to become the "academic and administrative center" of Galilee during the 10. Ed.

Josephus may actually have been trying to refute Justus' accusation that it was he who forced Tiberias to revolt. Accordingly, Justus, in his own history, tried to convince the Romans some twenty or thirty years after the war that the Tiberians had really wanted to remain loyal and as a consequence their city deserved autonomy just as much as Sepphoris. Josephus' response was to portray Justus as the real scoundrel. See S. J. D. Cohen, Josephus in Galilee and Rome.: His "Vita" and Development as a Historian (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1979), pp. 138-141. 12. M. Goodman, State and Society in Roman Galilee A.D. 132-212 (Totowa, N.J.: Rowman &amp; Allanheld, 1983), p. 134.

MILLER amoraic period and speaks of the city's "far outshadowing its longtime competitor [emphasis added], Sepphoris."'5 Tiberias did indeed assume a more important position by the end of the third century, subsequent to the reestablishment there of the Sanhedrin and presumably the patriarchal house, both of which had formerly been located at Sepphoris.'6 The relationship between Sepphoris and Tiberias, however, needs to be re-examined. Disputes and rivalries among the cities of the Roman East were common and persistent enough, so that it is not implausi- ble that tensions between Sepphoris and Tiberias continued long after the First Revolt. While disputes often resulted from differences over bounda- ries, rivalries over rank and titles were also common."7 Thus Ephesus and 15. R. Kimelman, "Rabbi Yohanan of Tiberias: Aspects of the Social and Religious History of Third Century Palestine" (Ph.D. diss., Yale University, 1977), pp. 51, 54. Also see p. 84 n. 39, where Life 37 is referred to. 16. According to S. Baron, A Social and Religious History of the Jews, 19 vols. (New York and Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1937-), 2:108, Tiberias was "rapidly becoming the major center of Jewish life in the country" already during the Hadrianic period. This is an overstatement. Tiberias' emergence as the most important rabbinic center in Galilee seems to have been a gradual one which stemmed from developments in the mid-third century. About that time, the Sanhedrin relocated to Tiberias, and R. Yohanan, who had also recently arrived from Sepphoris, was beginning to achieve prominence as the head of an academy there. (On Yohanan and Tiberias, see Kimelman, "Rabbi Yobanan," p. 54.) It is even possible that the patriarchal house remained in Sepphoris until the end of the third century despite the earlier move of the Sanhedrin to Tiberias. See Miller, Studies, p. 118 n. 315, and S. Safrai, "Ha-Yishuv Ha-Yehudi Ba-Galil U-Va-Golan Ba-Me'ot Ha-Shelishit Ve-Ha-Revi'it," in A.

For the view that the patriarchal house and the Sanhedrin were inseparable, see Cohen, "Ha-'Im U-Matai," pp. 117 f. Curiously, Cohen maintains that the patriarchal house moved to Tiberias in the mid-third century but assumes that Tiberias surpassed Sepphoris in importance already during the time of Rabbi Judah Ha-Nasi; thus he addresses the question of why the patriarch chose Sepphoris as his home in the first place. See Cohen, "Ha-'Im U-Matai," pp. 120-122. 17. Boundary disputes are discussed in F. Millar, The Emperor in the Roman World 31 BC-AD 337 (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1977), pp. 435 f. For rivalry over rank and titles, see the sources referred to in the following note. These rivalries often found expression in the expensive building campaigns, games, and festivals in which cities indulged. See F. Abbott and A. C. Johnson, Municipal Administration in the Roman Empire (New York: Russel &amp; Russel, 1926), pp. 81, 142 f., and 218. Also, A. H. M.

The right to be regarded as a "temple warden" (neokoros) was also jealously guarded by the cities. See D. Magie, Roman Rule in Asia Minor, 2 vols.

The emperor (Antoninus) eventually intervened in this case, establishing the titles by which each city could expect to be addressed by the other.19 The issue of primacy (pr6teion) persisted, however, into the third century, and by that time Pergamum had become a third contestant for a leading title.20 Similarly, in the early second century, Nicaea and Nicomedia were at odds over pr6teion, as both wished to be regarded as the first city of Bithynia. Here too, the feud continued for several centuries.21 The rivalry between Sepphoris and Tiberias described by Josephus would seem to be yet another example of a dispute over rank, as the historian makes it quite clear that pr6teion was the issue between these cities.22 Unfortunately, the titles assumed by both cities from the first century on do not necessarily reflect this dispute or shed any light on its persistence. That Sepphoris and Tiberias assumed prestigious titles in the first century is pretty well documented. According to Josephus, Herod Antipas made Sepphoris "the ornament of all Galilee" (proschima tou Galilaiou pantos) and called it "Autokratoris," perhaps alluding to its status as a capital city.23 18. he pr6ti kai megist? metropolis tts Asias.

It seems that Nicaea continued along with Nicomedia to be regarded as "first" until it supported Pescennius Niger's war against Sep- timius Severus. After Niger's defeat, Nicomedia had the phrase "the first of the province" erased from Nicaea's monuments. The rivalry persisted, however, into late antiquity. See Jones, Roman World, pp. 84, 87. Some aspects of the friction between Nicaea and Nicomedia are considered below. 22. See the passage quoted above. 23. See Josephus, Ant., XVIII, 27.

MILLER Coins struck during the First Revolt at Sepphoris commemorate the city's pro-Roman stance with the titles "Neronias" and "Eirenopolis" ("city of peace").24 Curiously, coins minted in Tiberias in 99/100 C.E. refer to that city as "Claudiopolis," perhaps in commemoration of some honor bestowed upon it earlier by the emperor Claudius (41-54 C.E.).25 It is possible that this designation was assumed with the intention of contrasting Tiberias with Sepphoris/Neronias, as Nero was Claudius' successor and was responsible for Tiberias' loss of freedom.26 Still, the projection of the pre-Revolt rivalry into the final years of the first century would be speculative at best, especial- ly since Sepphoris had adopted its title considerably earlier, in 67-68 C.E.27 Nor are the later titles and ranks of Sepphoris and Tiberias any more informative. The coins minted at Sepphoris under Antoninus Pius (138-161 C.E.) bear the legend "Diocaesarea, the Sacred, City of Shelter and Autono- mous."28 Actually, the city was already called Diocaesarea in the time of Hadrian (who had adopted the title Zeus Olympius), as the name appears on a milestone from ca. 130 C.E.29 The pagan imagery found on the coins befits a city whose leadership may have been assumed by gentiles in the interim.3" The Jewish inhabitants of Sepphoris could hardly have been 24. See Meshorer, "Sepphoris and Rome," pp. 160-162; idem, "Matbe'ot Zippori," pp. 185-187; Cohen, Josephus, pp. 245 f.; and Miller, Studies, p. 3. 25. Cf. Schuirer, History 2:180, and Kindler, "Matbe'ot Teveryah," p. 52. The title first appears on coins minted under Trajan and continues in various forms until the time of Elagabalus. The complete form: Tib(erieon) Kl(audiopolition) Sur(ias) Pal(aistines) is found on coins of Commodus from 189/190 C.E. and similarly in an inscription in Rome from after 135 C.E. designating an establishment (statio) of some sort belonging to the Tiberians. See E. M. Smallwood, The Jews Under Roman Rule (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1976), p. 522; and cf. Schiirer, History, 2:181, who defines statio as a "guild-hall." 26. See Cohen, Josephus, p. 141, and cf. T. Rajak, "Justus of Tiberias," Classical Quarterly 23 (1973): 350. Cohen also suggests (n. 141) that both Sepphoris and Tiberias were permitted to mint coins in order "to avoid exacerbating tension between the two cities." 27. It could of course be maintained that Tiberias assumed the title "Claudiopolis" during the reign of Claudius (41-54 C.E.), but there is no evidence that such was the case. See, however, M. Avi-Yonah, "Teveryah Bi-Tequfah Ha-Roma'it," in Kol 'Ere; Naftali, ed. H. Z. Hirshberg (Jerusalem: Israel Exploration Society, 1967), pp. 154 f.

Coins issued under Caracalla (211-218 C.E.) and Elagabalus (218-222 C.E.), however, include, in addition to the earlier titles, a reference to the "friendship" (philia) and "alliance" (symmachia) between the "Holy Council" (hiera boule) of Diocaesarea the "Loyal" (pistC) and the Senate of the Roman people.3' Y. Meshorer claims that the hiera boulh must have been the Jewish council-perhaps even the Sanhedrin-and the coins are indicative of the improved relations with Rome which marked the career of the patriarch Rabbi Judah Ha-Nasi, who lived toward the end of his life at Sepphoris.32 Be that as it may, the terms philia and symmachia were often used by cities wishing to enhance their own prestige by recalling an imaginary or real relationship with Rome in the distant past.33 Perhaps the boulh of Sepphoris sought to do just that in the early third century by invoking the city's relationship with Rome during the First Revolt. The reference to the city as "Loyal" would seem to be a further reminder of Sepphoris's earlier faithfulness to Rome.34 In any event, the only indication that Tiberias too was interested in upgrading its status in the early third century is a talmudic source (B. 'Avodah Zarah 10a) that suggests that the city became a colonia about that time.35 There simply is no way of knowing, however, whether the accumulation of titles by either Sepphoris or Tiberias was symptomatic of an ongoing struggle for supremacy. Provinces (Oxford: At the Clarendon Press, 1937), p. 279; and idem, "The Urbanization of Palestine," Journal of Roman Studies 21 (1931): 82. Cf. Jones's somewhat different view in his Greek City, p. 81. Also see Miller, Studies, pp. 31-59, where it is argued that the Romans maintained a castra at Sepphoris during the second century. 31. Meshorer, "Sepphoris and Rome," pp. 168 f.; idem, "Matbe'ot Zippori," pp. 194-197; and idem, Matbe'ot 'Arei 'EreZ Yisra'el, p. 37. 32. Meshorer suggests that the Holy Council of Sepphoris actually entered into "a treaty of friendship and alliance" with the Senate of the Roman people. He also calls attention to coins of Agrippa I which refer to a similar treaty made between the king and the Romans. For another view of the coins, see C.M. Kraay, "Jewish Friends and Allies of Rome," American Numismatic Society Museum Notes 25 (1980); 56f. 33. See Magie, Roman Rule, 1:637, and cf. Jones, Greek City, p. 324. 34. Meshorer may still be correct that Sepphoris and Rome enjoyed particularly good rela- tions in the early third century, perhaps even officially acknowledged by some sort of treaty. The point made here is that the claim of Sepphoris for Rome's favor would have been based on the historical relationship of the cities. It should be noted that a papyrus from 359 C.E. also designates Ascalon as pistd. See Schilrer, History 2:107 n. 111. 35. The source has "Antoninus" (presumably Caracalla) reveal to Rabbi Judah Ha-Nasi his desire to make Tiberias a colony. For a full discussion, see Kimelman, "Rabbi Yohanan," pp. 48-51. The only other source referring to Tiberias as a colony is a marriage contract preserved in the Cairo Geniza and dated to 1034/35 C.E. See M. A. Friedman, Jewish Marriage in Palestine.: A Cairo Geniza Study, 2 vols. (Tel Aviv and New York: Tel Aviv University/ Jewish Theological Seminary, 1980-81), 2:207 f., 211.</page><page sequence="8">8 STUART S. MILLER It is reasonable, however, to look for evidence of the persistence of the rivalry of which Josephus speaks (or any other forms of tension between Sepphoris and Tiberias) in rabbinic literature. Rivalries among the cities of the Roman Empire were often mirrored by the friction between their eccle- siastical authorities. Thus various bishoprics of the empire (e.g., Nicaea and Nicomedia) are reported to have contended over primacy, with their city's political rank as the basis of their claims.36 Moreover, urban intellectual life may also have been affected by intercity tensions. Hence the feud between the second-century sophists Favorinus of Ephesus and Polemo of Smyrna appears to have been an outgrowth of the rivalry between their respective cities.37 If the rivalry between Sepphoris and Tiberias went beyond the first century, as maintained by the above-mentioned authors, it would not be surprising if the rabbis took notice of it. Indeed, if there was constant ten- sion between Sepphoris and Tiberias, we would expect some indication of it to appear in rabbinic literature, the major source for the history of these cities.38 An examination of the traditions which mention both Tiberias and Sepphoris should shed some light on both the relationship between the two cities and the rabbinic attitudes toward them. Sepphoris and Tiberias in Rabbinic Literature The traditions are found in the Tosefta, the Palestinian and Babylonian 36. See A. H. M. Jones, The Later Roman Empire 284--602: A Social, Economic and Administrative Survey, 2 vols. (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1964), 2:882 f. 37. See G.W. Bowersock, Greek Sophists in the Roman Empire (Oxford: At the Clarendon Press, 1969), pp. 90 f., and Jones, Roman World, p. 78. 38. The assumption here is that the rabbis would have made direct reference to such tension or, at the very least, would have alluded (either consciously or unconsciously) to its existence, as Sepphoris and Tiberias were the major centers of Jewish life in Galilee. Recently, Neusner has argued that the city "lay beyond the social experience of the rabbis," who were more familiar with life in the villages and towns. This observation does not affect the position taken here that talmudic literature should be used to address the question of urban rivalry, as Neusner characterizes both Sepphoris and Tiberias as "towns" rather than cities. The larger metropolises which Neusner regards as "cities" are the places which he contends most rabbis would not have been able to relate to. See J. Neusner, "The City as Useless Symbol in Late Antique Judaism," in idem, Major Trends in Formative Judaism: Society and Symbol in Political Crisis (Chico, Calif.: Scholars Press, 1983), pp. 33, 38. Besides the discussion of the relations between Sepphoris and Tiberias found in Josephus, there really is no other Greek or Latin writing that sheds light on our topic, though both cities occasionally appear in classical litera- ture.</page><page sequence="9">INTERCITY RELATIONS IN ROMAN PALESTINE 9 Talmudim, and the Midrashei Aggadah.39 The cities appear together in both halakhic and aggadic contexts, where they are referred to in various ways to clarify the subject at hand. The forty or so relevant traditions may thus be broken down into four types, the most prominent examples of which will be presented here.40 The largest group consists of passages in which Sepphoris and Tiberias are used merely as loci. In these instances, places other than Sepphoris and Tiberias could just as easily have been chosen to explicate a halakhah or dramatize an aggadah. For example, in a discussion of the prohibition of writing on the Sabbath, both the Palestinian and Babylonian gemarot use the example of one who writes one letter of the alphabet in Tiberias and one in Sepphoris to indicate a culpable act.41 Elsewhere, R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus is asked by the epitropos of Agrippa whether he can fulfill his obligation to eat fourteen meals in the sukkah by eating one meal each day of Tabernacles in each of his two sukkot, one of which was in Sepphoris, the other in Tiberias.42 Regarding the question of whether a wife has to actually receive a get within her home for a divorce to be effected, R. Hoshaiah, a first-generation amora from Sepphoris, explains that the document may even be delivered to her courtyard in Sepphoris while she is in Tiberias, or vice versa.43 In a discussion of the kashrut of a slaughtered animal that has been found, it is decided that the area of the find is deter- minative. That is, if the animal was found in a place known for its Jewish settlement, such as the area between Sepphoris and Tiberias, it is permitted for consumption.44 The distance between the two cities is used by R. Ammi to illustrate just how far a yevamah has to go to meet with a yabam in order to be released from the obligations of a levirate marriage.45 Among aggadic traditions two stand out: One drives home the extent of the Hadrianic 39. The Palestinian Talmud contains considerably more traditions than the other sources mentioned. Most of the relevant material has been collected in S. Klein, ed., Sefer Ha- Yishuv, vol. I (Jerusalem: Yad Izhak ben Zvi, 1939), pp. 60-62. Also see Klein, "Zippori," pp. 63 f. 40. This typology should not be considered absolute, as several of the traditions can be included in more than one of the categories presented here (cf. below, n. 48). This in no way detracts from either the analysis of the traditions or the argument which follows. A further breakdown of the traditions by genres or periods (i.e., tannaitic, amoraic) reveals nothing concerning their content and usages and so has been avoided. 41. P. Shabbat 12, 13d, and B.

MILLER devastation by stating that the emperor had a vineyard surrounded by a fence of corpses eighteen miles square; in order to vividly portray this distance, it is noted that Tiberias and Sepphoris were eighteen miles apart.46 The other tradition attributes the statement "May it be my lot to be among those who welcome the Sabbath in Tiberias and among those who dismiss the Sabbath at Sepphoris" to the tanna R. Yose, himself a resident of Sepphoris.47 R. Yose is simply emphasizing the beauty of the Sabbath by indicating that he would not mind extending the day by beginning it in the lowlands of Tiberias (where the sun appears to set early) and ending it in the mountainous region of Sepphoris (where the sun appears to set late).48 The second group of traditions notes differences in the customs and realia of Sepphoris and Tiberias. For example, R. Abbahu is said to have maintained that one does not make a blessing over the spices he smells on Sabbath eve in Tiberias or those he smells on Saturday night in Sepphoris because "they were made for other purposes," that is, they were not in- tended exclusively for their odor.49 The commentators explain that it was the custom of the Tiberians to deodorize their clothes with the spices on the eve of the Sabbath, while the Sepphoreans did so after the Sabbath.5so While the halakhah is the same in either case, the fact that the Sepphoreans and Tiberians used the spices at different times is evident. A disagreement between R. Yehudah and the hakhamim which appears in the Mishnah (Shevi'it 5:1) concerns the application of the sabbatical laws to Persian figs grown in 'Erez Yisra'el. The difference is explained by the Yerushalmi to have been the result of the fact that the figs took two years to ripen in Tiberias, which was R. Yehudah's point of reference, and only one year in Sepphoris, which is the area the hakhamim had in mind.5' In a discussion of 46. P. Ta'anit 4, 69a. 47. B. Shabbat 118b. 48.

Sanhedrin 10, 28a); Genesis Rabbah 18:23; and Leviticus Rabbah 18:1 (= Ecclesiastes Rabbah 12:6). Many of the traditions considered below can actually be included here as well. However, since they have other characteristics besides the use of Sepphoris and Tiberias as loci, they have been assigned to different groups. The traditions discussed here use Sepphoris and Tiberias exclusively as loci without noting differences, similarities, or traffic between the cities, as do the types now to be presented. 49. P.

The next group of traditions relevant to our discussion includes a tannaitic rebuke of the men of both Sepphoris and Tiberias for not trimming their hair in honor of the Sabbath, something that even Absalom was believed to have done.54 A gloss to a baraita in the Bavli indicates that the two cities used similar weights."55 An amoraic discussion of work during Iol ha-Mo'ed notes that the net-fishermen of Tiberias and the grist-makers of Sepphoris would abstain from work during that period.56 In a midrashic exposition of Genesis 41:48, "He [Joseph] put in each city the grain of the fields around it," the rabbis explain that the blessing of plenty had to have occurred in the storage houses, for indeed if all the people of Tiberias and all the people of Sepphoris would gather to eat the food contained in each city's domain, each person would end up with only a handful.57 In a midrash to Psalms 1:3, "And he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water," Tiberias and its scholars (havruteih) and Sepphoris and its scholars are likened to "streams of water" near which trees, i.e., Torah, are "planted."58 Similarly, in yet another midrash, this time to Ecclesiastes 11:3, "if a tree 52.

MILLER falls to the south or to the north, the tree will stay where it falls," it is explained that all of Israel come to pay their respects when a sage passes away. The deaths of R. Mana in Sepphoris and of R. Abun in Tiberias, two amoraim of the fourth century, are given as examples.59 The final group of traditions reports on various trips made by the rabbis between the two cities. Here the usual form is "Rabbi so-and-so went up from Tiberias to Sepphoris . . ." Interestingly, the reported trip usually began in Tiberias and not in Sepphoris; the likely explanation for this is that most of these traditions appear in the Palestinian Talmud and in Leviticus Rabbah, both works which contain much material from Tiberias or the Sea of Galilee region.60 At any rate, examples of each genre include the report attributed to R. Simeon bar Yobai that he was able to travel from Tiberias to Sepphoris (and from Tyre to Sidon) on the Sabbath without violating the tehum shabbat because of the caves and burqii which extended the limits of the city of departure.6' On a journey from Tiberias to Sepphoris, R. Simeon ben Gamaliel is said to have met an old man who informed him of the nature of the various boils which render one impure.62 Elsewhere, R. Hani- nah is reported to have ruminated over why he was blessed with longevity and guessed that it was his reward for stopping in to see R. Simeon ben H.alafta in Ein Tenah whenever he was en route to Sepphoris from Tiber- ias.63 Three traditions involve the amora R. Yobanan, who apparently lived his early years in Sepphoris before establishing his yeshivah in Tiberias.64 Thus Yohanan, on one of his trips to his earlier hometown, is said to have inquired about the great commotion he heard coming from Sepphoris as he approached the city; it turned out to have been the result of the preparations 59. Ecclesiastes Rabbah 11:3. For a midrash in which both cities appear to be facing a calamity, see Pesiqta' Rabbati 8:3. 60. This phenomenon may also reflect the final ascendancy of Tiberias as well as the editorial work done there. In this regard, it should also be noted that almost all of the Sepphoris/Tiberias traditions, not just those reporting trips between the two cities, mention Tiberias first. See Safrai, "Ha-Yishuv Ha-Yehudi," p. 167 n. 156. On the editing of the materials in the Yerushalmi, see S. Lieberman, "Talmudah Shel-Kisrin," Tarbi4 2 (1931), Supplement, 9 f.

Haninah's funeral.'65 On another occasion an elderly Yolanan is helped along on his excursion to Sepphoris by R. Hiyya bar Abba, to whom he explains that he had sold various fields, vineyards, and olive groves between the two cities so that he could study Torah.66 Curiously, the one tradition which has a sage going from Sepphoris to Tiberias also involves R. Yolhanan. This passage in the Yerushalmi indicates that Yolhanan left Sepphoris for Tiberias as a result of an offense he suffered in the academy of Sepphoris.67 Finally, it should be noted that trips between the two cities were so taken for granted that at least on one occasion the formula used is "like an individual who went up from Tiberias to Sepphoris," that is, a specific trip is not intended.68 The appearance of Sepphoris and Tiberias in the same contexts in rabbinic literature was clearly not intended, even in those traditions which contrast the cities, to show the superiority of one over the other or the exis- tence of tensions between them. Though the Sepphoris/Tiberias traditions may be grouped into the four distinct types described, it must be remem- bered that they were all formed in order to drive home either a halakhic or an aggadic point. The rabbis referred to these two cities because they were, particularly in the amoraic period, the two leading centers of Jewish life in Galilee, in which many of them also happened to live or study. The question then is not whether rabbinic literature intentionally portrays Sepphoris and Tiberias antithetically,69 but rather, do any of the traditions even so much as allude to the supposed trouble between them? 65.

The fact that rabbinic literature does at times portray the Sepphoreans negatively (e.g., P. Ta'anit 3, 66c) does not detract from the argument presented here. First of all, it would have to be proven that all or most of these traditions emanate from Tiberian sources. Second, if the Sepphoreans were generally regarded as lacking character, and the Tiberians were responsible for conveying this impression, the Sepphoris/Tiberias traditions would almost certainly contain some overt reference to the Sepphoreans' faults. (Similar objections could be raised to the suggestion that the Sepphoreans were responsible for the traditions that cast aspersions on the purity of Tiberias. These traditions cannot be shown to have originated in Sepphoris, and some reference to the question of the purity of Tiberias would have been expected among the Sepphoris/Tiberias traditions. See the ensuing discussion.) For the passages dealing with the character of the Sepphoreans, see A.

Two previously unmentioned passages from rabbinic literature have been seen as allusions to the persistence of the rivalry of which Josephus speaks into the later, talmudic period. L. Levine has suggested that Sepphorean scholars were the source of an ongoing polemic concerning the purity of the city of Tiberias.70 He proposes that the following passage from B. Megillah 6a alludes to Sepphorean resentment of Tiberias (represented here by Naphtali, in whose territory the city was located) in the fourth century:7 A. Zeira said, "Qitron is Sepphoris, and why is it called Sepphoris [Hebrew: Zippori]? Because it sits on top of a mountain like a bird [Hebrew: ;ippor]." B. But is Qitron Sepphoris? Surely Qitron is in the territory of Zevulun. For it is written [Judg. 1:30]: "Zevulun did not dispossess the inhabitants of Qitron or the inhabitants of Nahalol." C. But Zevulun was discontented with its portion [of land] as it is said [Judg. 5:18]: "Zevulun is a people that mocked at death."72 For what reason? Because Naphtali was "on the open heights" [Judg. 5:18]. D. Zevulun [himself] said before The Holy One, Praised be He, "Master of the World, to my brothers you gave fields and vineyards, but to me you gave mountains and hills; to my brothers you gave lands, but to me you gave lakes and streams." 1974), pp. 124, 146, 160. Elsewhere, Lieberman remarks, "Sepphoris was notorious in the age of the Palestinian Talmud for its boisterous and rebellious spirit and for its many criminals." He derives this characterization from P. Ma'aser Sheni, 5, 55d. See his "Jewish Life in Eretz Yisra'el as Reflected in the Palestinian Talmud," reprinted in Texts and Studies, p. 186. On the perception of the priests of Sepphoris, see Miller, Studies, pp. 102, 130. I am planning to publish an analysis of the anti-Sepphoris/Sepphoreans traditions. 70. "R. Simeon b.

He [God] replied to him, "They will all need you for the bilazon [a fish from which a purple dye for the ;igit was extracted], as it is said [in reference to Zevulun in Deut. 33:19]:'[For they draw from the riches of the sea] And the hidden hoards of the sand.' " F. Rav Yosef taught, "'Hidden'-this [refers to] bilazon; 'hoards'-this [refers to] tunny fish; 'sand'-this [refers to] white glass.".. G. Now, if you maintain that Qitron is Sepphoris, why was [the tribe of] Zevulun discontented with its portion? Surely, Sepphoris was very desirable! And if you say that it does not flow with milk and honey, did Resh Lakish not say, "I myself have seen the flowing milk and honey of Sepphoris, and it [covers an area of] sixteen miles by sixteen miles?"... H. Even so, fields and vineyards are [more] desirable to it [the tribe of Zevulun]. According to Levine, Sepphoris' antagonism toward Tiberias is revealed here through Zevulun's jealous remarks pertaining to Naphtali.73 The pas- sage follows an amoraic discussion of whether Tiberias had been a walled city in the time of Joshua bin Nun. The gemara (5b) identifies Tiberias with Raqqat, mentioned in Joshua 19:35. Yolhanan, however, disagrees, main- taining instead that Hammat, which also appears in the verse, is Tiberias, and Raqqat is Sepphoris. Though Zeira finally equates Sepphoris with Qitron (A), it is interesting that Yolhanan, who headed an academy at Tiberias, is said to have been responsible for the identification with Raqqat. For indeed, had Sepphoris and Raqqat been identical, the above passage would have been altogether impossible. That is, Sepphoris too would have been in the land apportioned to Naphtali in Joshua (19:32 ff.), and so Zevulun would not have even entered the discussion, let alone been used as a cover for Sepphorean feelings toward Tiberias (Naphtali). Furthermore, it is unlikely that behind Zevulun's protest lies resentment felt by the Seppho- reans toward Tiberias. On the contrary, the point of the passage is not that the Sepphoreans were unhappy but rather that Zevulun was dissatisfied with its portion, although it included Qitron, i.e., Sepphoris. The tribe's lot (and therefore that of Sepphoris) is viewed positively despite the fact that Zevulun himself may have preferred the "fields and vineyards" of Naphtali. The aggadah (C-F) has God respond to Zevulun that his territory will be needed for its hilazon, and Rav Yosef concludes from the biblical proof-text 73. "R. Shimon b. Yohai," p. 177.</page><page sequence="16">16 STUART S. MILLER (Deut. 33:19) that tunny fish and white glass were also to be counted among the tribe's resources. Moreover, in a context which also extolls the virtues of Raqqat/Tiberias,74 it is rather striking that another prominent Tiberian, Resh Lakish, notes the fertility of Sepphoris, whose milk and honey flowed for sixteen square miles. Even here, the purpose is to express surprise at Zevulun's dissatisfaction which the rabbis perceived in Judges 5:18: "Zevulun is a people that mocked at death." The intent throughout is, therefore, exegetical. In fact, Zevulun's com- plaints and the material explaining the benefits bestowed upon his tribe's territory (C-F) make perfectly good sense apart from the context identify- ing Sepphoris with Qitron. To be sure, the interest of the gemara in the identity of Sepphoris generated the exegesis and is the overall concern of the passage. But the exegesis elaborating Zevulun's disillusionment can stand alone, in which case neither Sepphoris nor Tiberias would be explicitly mentioned."75 In fact, the passage does not even mention Tiberias, and where Tiberian scholars (Yohanan, Resh Lakish, Assi, Zeira, Jeremiah, Rabbah bar Hannah)76 do appear in the larger context, there is no polemic with Sepphoris, apparent or otherwise.77 A perhaps more suggestive passage, which is often cited when either the rivalry between the cities or Tiberias' final ascendancy is discussed," is found in P. Sanhedrin 3, 21a.79 A. R. Eleazar said, "One [litigant] suggested [that the case be decided in] Tiberias, and the other suggested [that it be decided in] Sepphoris; they listen to the one who suggested Tiberias." 74. B. Megillah 6a reports that the residents of Tiberias are full of religious observances, the city is the center of 'Ere2 Yisra'el, and its appearance is good. 75. Cf. Levine, "R. Simeon b. Yobai," p. 177 n. 138, who maintains that Sepphoris and Tiberias are "at the center of this exegesis." 76. Assi, Zeira, and Rabbah bar bar Hannah were all originally Babylonians who emi- grated and studied under Yobanan. Jeremiah was also a Babylonian by birth who eventually studied with Zeira. 77. Cf. the obvious tension between Caesarea and Jerusalem which appears in the material following our passage in B. Megillah 6a. See below, "Conclusion." 78. See Levine, "R. Simeon b.

La [Ila] said, "And that which R. Eleazar said, 'One suggested Tiberias and the other suggested Sepphoris, concerns those who were sitting in maskanah,; from here to there [Tiberias] is seven miles, from here to there [Sepphoris] is nine miles."s80 C. R. Yose said, "And you derive from it that if two people are involved in a case in Tiberias, and one says [that the case should be decided] in the greater bet din, and the other says [that it should be decided] in the lesser bet din, the one who suggests the greater bet din is listened to." This passage appears as a digression in a discussion of M. Sanhedrin 3:1, which is concerned with the finding of judges who will be acceptable to the disputants in cases involving property. After a discussion of this matter, the gemara considers the appropriateness of moving a case from one venue to another. Thus R. Yolhanan is said to have responded to an individual in Antioch that he should have his case tried locally and if necessary send the case to the "rabbanan," presumably of Tiberias, for final resolution. Our passage introduces an entirely new element in that two courts of 'Ereg Yisra'el are involved, those of Tiberias and Sepphoris. These courts were presumably on a more equal footing than those of'Antioch and Tiberias.A Nevertheless, it seems that here too the closer, more convenient court, i.e., that of Tiberias, is resorted to. Still, R. Eleazar, a late-third-century Tiberian, does not explain his preference for his city's court, and so the explanations of R. Ila and R. Yose are offered.82 Many of the commentaries have a different reading of R. Ila's statement. Instead of placing maskanah, which is assumed to be a dwelling of some sort, at a distance of seven miles 80. The assumption here that the first "from here to there" means "from maskanah to Tiberias," and the second, "from maskanah to Sepphoris," is based on the likelihood that "Maskanah" is the name of an actual place which indeed is closer to Tiberias than to Sepphoris. See the ensuing discussion. Also, as seen earlier (n. 60), almost all of the Sepphoris/ Tiberias traditions mention Tiberias first. For an altogether different rendering, see Penei Mosheh, ad loc. 81. Mantel suggests that the Antiochean court may not have had ordained scholars or that the rabbanan referred to in the passage may mean "the Great Court" of Tiberias. See H. Mantel, Studies in the History of the Sanhedrin (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1961), p. 223 n. 342. Presumably, the courts of both Sepphoris and Tiberias were composed of ordained scholars, though Tiberias' court system may have been of a higher rank. See the discussion below. 82. Two lines of text (between A and B) have been omitted from our discussion because they are really a digression on other themes suggested by the Mishnah. The omitted material includes such terms as mevi' ("brings") and posel ("disqualifies"), which are reminiscent of the Mishnah, and shanu ("they taught"), which probably refers to the sages mentioned there.

MILLER from Tiberias, they present it as equidistant from both cities. Thus the disputants were nine miles from Sepphoris and nine miles from Tiberias.83 R. Ila would then be reading into R. Eleazar's opinion the superiority of the Tiberian court and perhaps even some degree of rivalry with Sepphoris. R. Yose's opinion-that is, that the greater court within a given city is to be preferred to the lesser court within the same city-would appear then to be a further extension of this understanding, taking for granted that the reason for R. Eleazar's preference for the Tiberian court was its supremacy over that of Sepphoris.84 That the rabbis were interested in ensuring that a particular case was brought to the appropriate court could be expected. The question of juris- diction was certainly not peculiar to Jewish or rabbinic courts. What is interesting, however, is that the venue of legal proceedings was often an issue that led to strife and jealousies between the cities of antiquity. Thus Dio Chrysostom contrasts the rivalry between Nicomedia and Nicaea over pr6teion with that of Athens and Sparta, who "fought each other over the right of every man to have his lawsuits tried in his own home city."'85 In pointing out that the real issue is one over "name and nothing more,"'86 Dio asks the Nicomedians whether the recovery of primacy would mean that they would be able to summon for trial those cities which are now subject to Nicaea.87 Sovereignty and judicial supremacy went hand in hand among the Greek states, who often made treaties to formalize matters of jurisdiction.88 The cities of the Roman Empire, however, could not claim this type of sovereignty or make treaties and instead yearned to be designated assize (conventus) centers.89 Dio's point to the Nicomedians is that the acquisition 83. See, for example, Ijiddushei Ha-Ramban to B. Sanhedrin, chap. 3, and Nimmuqei Yosef on Alfasi at the beginning of the same chapter. Also, the commentaries referred to by S. Lieberman in his review of S. Klein, ed., Sefer Ha-Yishuv, Sinai 5 (1940): 463. Lieberman contends that the correct reading is nine miles, as P. Ta'anit 4, 69a, indicates that the distance between Tiberias and Sepphoris is eighteen miles (see above). He also refers to P. Berakhot, 9, 14d, as evidence that maskanah was located exactly between the two cities. On this source see below, n. 95. 84. Cf. Penei Mosheh on the passage. 85. Or. 38:25.

Before then, the residents of Prusa had to bring their suits elsewhere, perhaps even to their rival, Apamea.93 It would not be at all surprising if these jurisdictional squabbles and jealousies were also found among the local (non-Roman) courts of rival cities.94 Does P. Sanhedrin 3, 21a, pit the court systems of Sepphoris and Tiberias against one another? If so, does the passage serve as evidence, though indirect, of two cities that were at odds in the talmudic period? To answer these questions we must take a closer look at our passage. First of all, MS Leiden does place maskanah seven miles from Tiberias and nine from Sepphoris. Furthermore, M. Avi-Yonah, S. Klein, and others take maskanah to be a proper noun identical with Khirbet Meskene, which was indeed located closer to Tiberias than to Sepphoris.95 Thus R. Ila may 90. As both cities probably possessed assize rights. See Jones, Roman World, p. 86. 91. Or. 35:15-17. Cf. Jones, Roman World, pp. 67 f. 92. Or. 40:33. Cf. 35:17 and Jones, Roman World, p. 68. 93. So suggests Jones, Roman World, pp. 108 f. 94. At least three court systems flourished in 'Ere? Yisra'el at this time: Roman, village (Jewish), and rabbinic. See Goodman, State and Society, pp. 155-171. Cf. the functioning of the early church courts discussed in H. F. Jolowicz and B. Nicholas, Historical Introduction to the Study of Roman Law, 3d ed. (Cambridge: At the University Press, 1973,) pp. 448 f. 95. Apparently, the road between the cities branched off, forming two distinct routes to Tiberias, the shorter through Khirbet Meskene and the longer through the Wadi Fejjas. This would explain the discrepancy between P. Ta'anit 4, 69a, which puts the distance between the cities at eighteen miles (see n. 83), and the reading of MS Leiden, which suggests that the distance was only sixteen miles. See M. Avi-Yonah, Map of Roman Palestine (Jerusalem, 1939), pp. 37, 42; idem, Gazetteer of Roman Palestine (Jerusalem: Israel Exploration Society, 1976), p. 79; idem, Holy Land, p. 137; Klein, 'Erea Ha-Galil (reprint ed., Jerusalem: Mosad Ha-Rav Kuk, 1967), pp. 93, 116; and L. K6hler's review of Klein's Beitrage zur Geographie und Geschichte Galildias (Leipzig, 1909) in Theologische Literaturzeitung, 1910, no. 11, col. 327. The only other reference to maskanah in rabbinic literature occurs in P. Berakhot 9, 14d, which is taken by some as proof that this place (Avi-Yonah refers to it as a "road station") was exactly midway between Sepphoris and Tiberias (see n. 83). This source, however, merely uses the location as a convenient point between the two cities to illustrate the meaning of a verse from Megillat Hasidim: "Should you abandon Me for one day, I will abandon you for [many] days." Thus it is explained that two individuals, one from Tiberias, the other from Sepphoris, who take leave of one another at maskanah are not really thought of as having separated until they are two miles from each other. As each has gone a mile, they are now separated by two; so one who abandons God for one day is really separated from Him for longer. Khirbet Meskene need only have been regarded as approximately equidistant from Sepphoris and Tiberias, which indeed it was, for the passage to make sense. In any case, the distance from Khirbet Meskene to each of the cities is nowhere stated in the passage.</page><page sequence="20">20 STUART S. MILLER simply have been explaining R. Eleazar's statement by stating that the disputants in this particular case were closer to Tiberias and for that reason its court was to be preferred.96 R. Ila and R. Yose would then be offering two distinct explanations: for the former, distance was the issue; for the latter, judicial supremacy. In either case, however, rivalry between the cities is not evident. It should also be noted that there is an obvious Tiberian Tendenz in the sugia'. All of the amoraim mentioned in our passage and its context (Resh Lakish, Yolhanan, Eleazar, Zeira, Ila, and Yose) belonged to the circle of Yolhanan at Tiberias toward the end of the third century. From their point of view, the Tiberian court system would certainly have been the preferred one, especially since, as is likely, the Sanhedrin had already relo- cated to their city.97 In addition, even if the issue was that of the greater vs. the lesser court, the matter is purely of academic interest, with the two cities serving as loci, as in our first group of Sepphoris/Tiberias passages. Competition is simply not apparent in our passage, which serves as an expansion of the theme of the Mishnah. As mentioned earlier, M. Sanhedrin 3:1 is concerned with the appointment of judges who will be acceptable to the disputants. The Mishnah first indicates that each disputant is to choose a judge and then goes on to report the view of R. Meir that each can reject the other's appointee. After elaborating upon this subject, the gemara turns to the question of appropriate courts. The transition from the appointment of acceptable judges to that of using the appropriate court seems natural. In sum, though Tiberias' ascendancy may be taken for granted in the passage, there is no trace of any tension with Sepphoris. Conclusion: Intercity Rivalry in Rabbinic Literature The Sepphoris/Tiberias traditions as a whole do not contain any hint of rivalry, antagonism, or competition between the two cities, whether social, 96. The discussion in B. Sanhedrin 31b would seem to corroborate that R. Eleazar's concern is distance. Though the discussion there clearly involves lesser and greater courts, R. Eleazar is said to have taken the position that a debtor could not force a creditor to have their case tried before a higher court, as this would mean that the latter would have "to spend an additional maneh"; i.e., he would have to allot money for travel expenses. On the types of courts referred to in this passage, see S. Albeck, Battei Ha-Din Bi- Yemei Ha-Talmud (Ramat Gan: Bar Ilan University Press, 1980), pp. 117 f. 97. See the sources referred to above, n. 16. On the preference of the rabbis for "expert" (mumhim) courts, see M. B. Schwartz, "Appeals in the Jewish Courts of Palestine in the Third Century, C.E.," Hebrew Union College Annual 49 (1978): 196-199.</page><page sequence="21">INTERCITY RELATIONS IN ROMAN PALESTINE 21 political, or academic in nature. On the contrary, the traditions reflect the ongoing vitality of both Sepphoris and Tiberias even in the third and fourth centuries and emphasize both cities' continued prominence as academic centers.98 Even when the traditions note differences in customs or realia, the purpose, as at all other times, is to illustrate an aggadah or a halakhah. The intention is always didactic and not in any way polemical. As such the tradi- tions merely reflect the world of the rabbis, for whom Sepphoris and Tiberias were the two most important centers of Jewish life in Galilee. The rabbis of Sepphoris and Tiberias were simply not at odds, and if any rivalry existed between their two cities they were oblivious to it. Indeed, the tradi- tions suggest an atmosphere of mutual respect in which the larger issues of religious life and practice were the overriding concern. This is dramatically indicated by an already mentioned tradition, perhaps of the third century, that reports that the rabbis of Tiberias put aside their own view and instead adopted the Sepphorean practice of extending the prohibitions of the week of the Ninth of Av to the rest of the month.99 The preservation of traditions concerning the ongoing traffic between Sepphoris and Tiberias serves to further enhance the image of positive and constructive relations between these cities. Rabbinic literature does at times call attention to tension or resentment between the cities of 'Ere; Yisra'el, but never with regard to Sepphoris and Tiberias. In fact, when difficult relations are noted, a non-Jewish or quasi- Jewish city is usually involved. Thus the following passage appears in Lamentations Rabbah 1:17: "The Lord has summoned against Jacob his enemies all about him" [Lam. 1:17]. For example, Halamish to Naveh, Sussita to Tiberias, Castra to Haifa, Jericho to Naaram, and Lod to Ono.?00 98. Cf. Safrai, "Ha-Yishuv Ha-Yehudi," pp. 148, 151. 99. P. Ta'anit 4, 69b. The context in which this report appears contains the views of several late-third- to early-fourth-century scholars. Cf. also the discussion in B. Ta'anit 29b-30a. The Sepphoris/Tiberias traditions really do not favor either city. Note T. Sotah 3:16 which pre- serves a rabbinic rebuke of both the Sepphoreans and the Tiberians. Also interesting is B. Sanhedrin 31b where R. Ammi, a Tiberian, declares that a yevamah has to go "even from Tiberias to Sepphoris" to be released from a levirate marriage. Though the statement is in- tended to indicate a particular distance, the usage of Sepphoris as the destination in Ammi's time (late-third century), when Tiberias had the superior court, again suggests acceptance of, rather than contention with, an equally respectable rabbinic center. 100.

MILLER Naveh, Tiberias, Haifa, Naaram, and Ono were all Jewish cities. The "enemies of Jacob" here enumerated must refer to the gentile character or component of Halamish, Sussita (Hippos), Castra, Jericho, and Lod (Diospolis). '01 The passage does not refer to Sepphoris as the antagonist to Tiberias, but instead mentions Hippos-Sussita, a well-known Hellenistic center. Certainly, the Jewish character of Sepphoris precluded its being used as an "enemy" in the sense intended by the verse. Still, it is curious that another well-known center of Torah study, Caesarea, is often condemned in rabbinic literature and is presented as the antithesis of Jerusalem. Thus in B. Megillah 6a R. Isaac Napaha (late third century) regards Caesarea as "the daughter of Edom [Rome]" and compares the city, which served as a "metropolis of kings," unfavorably to Jerusalem. Caesarea and Jerusalem: If a person should say to you, "Both are destroyed," do not believe it; "Both are settled," do not believe it. "Caesarea is destroyed and Jerusalem settled" or "Jerusalem is destroyed and Caesarea settled," believe it, as it is said [Ezek. 26:2]: "I [Tyre] shall be filled, now that it [Jeru- salem] is laid in ruins." When this one is full [i.e., populated], the other is destroyed; when the other is full, this one is destroyed.'02 Similarly, Lamentations Rabbah to (Lam.) 1:5, "... Her foes are at ease," comments: "Until Jerusalem was destroyed, no city [medinah] in the world was regarded by them [the foes] as important; once it was destroyed, Caesarea became a metropolis."'03 Philo specifically refers to Jerusalem as a metropolis.'04 As this term was used to describe the most prominent city of a 101.

It must also be remembered that Caesarea contained a significant non-Jewish element.'06 Yet that this tension between Caesarea and Jerusalem would find overt expression in rabbinic literature suggests that the rabbis did not hesitate to take note of rivalry between cities, when in fact such rivalry existed."7 It could, of course, be maintained that the rabbis could not have seen the same extreme contrast between Sepphoris and Tiberias as they perceived between Caesarea and Jerusalem. Still, the competition between the latter is con- firmed by Christian sources, which note the tension between the bishoprics of Caesarea and Jerusalem in the third and fourth centuries;'08 no similar corroboration from external sources exists for a rivalry between Sepphoris and Tiberias. Furthermore, what the rabbis do have to say about Sepphoris and Tiberias can only lead to the conclusion that they were not aware of any tension between the two cities. In conclusion, rabbinic literature offers no evidence of any type of rivalry between Sepphoris and Tiberias. The pre-First Revolt tensions which Josephus relates are not in any way reflected in the traditions of the rabbis. The latter know nothing of either city's claim to be the legitimate capital of 105. On the use of the term "metropolis," see Jones, Roman World, pp. 74 f. 106. See Levine, Caesarea, pp. 29 f., on the conflict between Jews and Greeks in the city prior to the revolt. Also see chaps. 3, 4, 6, and 7 (passim) on the pagan, Samaritan, and Chris- tian elements in the city. 107. The passages just quoted may not prove that the rabbis were interested in document- ing rivalry between cities, but they do suggest that they were aware of its existence. As argued above, tension between Sepphoris and Tiberias would very likely have found expression in the traditions pertaining to both cities. Cf. n. 38. The fact that these traditions do not allude to difficulties between Sepphoris and Tiberias but instead emphasize their positive relations suggests that there was no rivalry to speak of. 108. See Z. Rubin, "The Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the Conflict between the Sees of Caesarea and Jerusalem," in The Jerusalem Cathedra, ed. L. Levine (Jerusalem: Yad Izhak ben Zvi, 1981-), vol. 2 (1982), pp. 79-105. To be sure, Lamentations Rabbah 1:5 and B. Megillah 6a were formulated long after Jerusalem had become a non-Jewish city. The rabbis probably use Jerusalem and Caesarea in these traditions as metaphors for Jews/Judaism and Rome/Romans respectively. Thus it could be maintained that these traditions have no bearing on the third- and fourth-century rivalry reflected in the Christian sources. Still, it does seem significant that the rabbis contrast Jerusalem and Caesarea. True, both Lamentations 1:5 and Ezekiel 26:2 concern Jerusalem, so it is no wonder that the city appears in the exegesis of these passages in Lamentations Rabbah and B. Megillah. Caesarea, of course, serves as a fitting foil. At the very least, however, the existing tensions between Jerusalem and Caesarea must have enhanced the rabbis' metaphorical usage of these cities and made it more intelligible.</page><page sequence="24">24 STUART S. MILLER Galilee. Furthernriore, the tendency of scholars to read the rivalry of Josephus' report into later rabbinic history is also unwarranted. The ques- tion of Tiberias' ascendancy as a rabbinic center at the end of the third century should be separated from that of the supposed competition between the two cities. The rise of Tiberias in importance does not presuppose the existence of competition with Sepphoris. Rabbinic literature does not mani- fest any struggle, tensions, or sudden diminution in Sepphoris' overall status. Josephus' report should not be regarded as anything more than a glimpse into the relations between Sepphoris and Tiberias in pre-First Revolt times.'09 University of Connecticut Storrs, Conn. 109. Several reasons could be offered for the discontinuance of the rivalry. First of all, Josephus' report may simply represent pre-First Revolt tensions and alliances that were no longer germane after the war and were soon forgotten. Alternatively, demographic changes, especially after the Bar-Kokhba Revolt, were bound to have an effect upon the attitudes and interests of the residents of both cities, who no longer could relate to the earlier squabbles. In any case, the silence of the rabbinic sources places the burden of proof upon those who would argue that the rivalry described by Josephus persisted.</page></plain_text>
