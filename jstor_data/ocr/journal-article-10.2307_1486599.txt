Edited by Peter Schifer and Joseph Dan In February 1992, at the tenth anni- versary of Scholem's death, a con- gress was held in Berlin which had two aims: to pay tribute to Scho- lem's achievement in the research of Jewish mysticism, and to define the state of present-day research in this field, 50 years after the publica- tion of Major RTends. This volume contains the presentation of the scholars participating in the con- gress, each of them a leading autho- rity in a particular area, according to the historical sequence establish- ed by Scholem: Merkavah Mysti- cism and Jewish Gnosticism, Hasi- dism in Medieval Germany, Abraham Abulafia and the Prophe- tic Kabbalah, the Circle of Contem- plation, the Zohar, Isaac Luria and the Safed School of Kabbalah, Sabbatai Zevi and Jacob Frank, Hasidism. 1993.410 pages (est.).

Naomi Shepherds collective biography of these seven women and others tells the story of a revolution that began at home, in communities whose limits stirred women to rebel. Each woman, whether feminist or unionist, Marxist scholar or Jewish Commissar, was a member of a distinct historical group. A Price below Rubies describes the middle-class Jewish families in Czarist Russia, the working-class women of the Jewish socialist movement, and the women revolutionary Zionists who were indispensable members of the Palestinian agricultural collectives. In Western Europe, we meet the semi-assimilated Jews whose daughters would dominate pacifist movements in Hungary and Holland and would create a vigorous Jewish feminism in Germany. $27.95 cloth Available at bookstores or from Harvard University Press Cambridge, MA 02138 Order toll-free: 800-448-2242 THE INGDM OFAusciwil This thoroughly accurate history of the Auschwitz concentration camp, where roughly 1.6 million people, mainly Jews, were killed, is a shocking and moving reading experience. In clear, straight- forward language, Otto Friedrich de- tails the founding and operation of the camp, vividly describes life within its walls, and relates personal stories of death and survival amid the cruelty, suffering, and heroism that defined the Holocaust. "I know of no work which brings the reality of this evil place so directly, vividly, accurately, movingly and clearly to the mind of the reader .. It is quite simply, the best short ac- count ever produced. For young people in particular, this is a neces- saryeye-opener... if theyreadnoth- ing else about the subject, they should read this.

It examines the personal and intellectual conflicts of modern Jews through the microscope and telescope of the scien- tist, the discourse of the philosopher, the imagery of the artist, poet and pho- tographer, and the tested faith of the Torah-keeping Jew. B'OR HA'TORAH was first published in Jerusalem in 1982 by the "Shamir" Publishing House and its Editor-in-Chief, Professor Herman Branover. After four issues of approximately 200 pages each, containing non-identical Eng- lish and Hebrew sections, it is now being produced in separate English and Hebrew volumes. Each issue costs $7.50, plus $3.50 air mail / $2.50 surface mail anywhere outside Israel. The new issue features: a special section on modern medicine and Jew- ish law - leading rabbis and doctors examine the Jewish approach to AIDS patients, organ donation, in-vitro fertilization and smoking; two pieces of orig- inal mathematics; a nutritionist's description of the chemical process of food digestion as a spiritual phenomenon: a look at the permissibility of Torah- observant Jews flying to outer space; an insight into the economic system of the Torah (capitalist in operation, socialist in attitude); a neurologist's claim that the belief in creatio ex nihilo separates Jews from all other people; and poetry, fiction, book reviews, art, and nature photography.
