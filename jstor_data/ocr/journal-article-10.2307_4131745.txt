<plain_text><page sequence="1">Yizhar Hirschfeld. Qumran in Context, Reassessing the Archaeological Evidence. Peabody, MA: Henderson Publishers, 2004. 220 pp; 136 figures. About 35,000 books and articles have been published thus far on the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS). The vast majority deal with the literature found in the eleven caves in the vicinity of Qumran and only a few deal with the archaeological re- mains of Khirbet Qumran nearby. The site was exhaustively excavated a few times in the past fifty-four years. The first that also determined the nature of its inter- pretation was carried out during 1951 to 1956 by Fr. Roland de Vaux from the French school of biblical studies at Jerusalem, the Ecole Biblique. Most of the site was unearthed during this excavation. The latest excavations were carried out in the past ten years and thus far with extremely meager publications. The prevailing theory since the onset of the excavations was that the scrolls were written by a sectarian, communal, monastic and celibate group called the Es- senes at the site of Qumran. Yizhar Hirschfeld of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem follows a small number of scholars who challenge this interpretation. Because the scrolls, the site, 373</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews and the Essenes are all entwined into a cohesive theory, it is virtually impossible to dismiss one without revising the others. Hirschfeld logically addresses every- thing, and naturally, not all with the same degree of success. In spite of some flaws, his archaeological revision is perhaps the best part of his entire attempt. One such a flaw is the lack of a chapter that presents a thorough history of the research. Readers are frequently lost between what Hirschfeld pro- poses as new and what is traditionally interpreted and known. To offer a new interpretation, Hirschfeld dismisses de Vaux's excavations en- tirely as "unscientific" and useless. The reason he gives is that, contrary to what is used today, de Vaux assigned the same loci numbers to single architectural units, although discerning several sequential floors in the same unit. This means that the finds assigned to loci numbers may originate from different strata, hence different periods. For example, the jewelry found at the site-conventional women's adorn- ment with no elevation reported-can be assigned to the Essenes' celibate society, which creates a severe conceptual problem. But this problem can be eliminated if the jewelry is assigned to the upper stratum of the Roman military, or to a Bedouin shepherd. In fact loci numbers are not so critical as long as the elevation of each find and basket are recorded. This data, matched with the elevation of the floors, would retrieve the finds' assemblages and indicate their precise association. Can this information be retrieved? Hirschfeld does not say. Having dismissed de Vaux's stratigraphy, Hirschfeld moves on to suggest a new stratigraphy based on architectural alterations and remodeling. Instead of the three "periods" suggested by de Vaux, he suggests four different strata with archi- tectural differences. The first occupation level, stratum I, dates from the late Iron Age, seventh through sixth centuries BCE. No distinctive architecture was ascribed by Hirschfeld to this period. The next, stratum II, is assigned to the Hasmonean period. It consists of a small fort (0.34 acre) protected by a strong tower reinforced by a revetment wall. The fort contained a courtyard, a pool, and a mikveh. Stratum III is assigned to the Herodian period, the period when the site reached it peak. The military stronghold was changed into a manor, a local Judean version of a Villa Rustica, owned by a patrician family from Jerusalem. New wings were added in all directions, and the site contained local industry as well as a center for produc- tion of the precious balsam ointment. Stratum IV marks the period after the Jew- ish Roman war in which Qumran served as a station for a small Roman garrison until the Bar Kokhba revolt in 132-35 CE. As evidence for his proposal, Hirschfeld presents the different strata in an archaeological context, hence the name of the book. The Hasmonean fort is, there- fore, similar in concept to other known forts. In this respect the town of Stratonos Pyrgos, the former name of Caesarea on the Mediterranean coast, perhaps had a similar appearance.1 However plausible, this proposal remains a hypothesis and requires presen- tation of the entire array of evidence. All pertinent walls have to be carefully 1. R.

Thus far, only a few nonsufficient samples are presented in the book. The context of the Herodian fortified manor is the culmination of the book and the one that instigated the research. Hirschfeld finds that the fortified manor is similar to several known elsewhere and particularly to Horvat cAqav at Ramat Hanadiv on the southern Carmel range, which he excavated for several years. Placing Qumran in the context of Herodian estates would place the DSS out of context-and indeed this is what they are in this book! The eleven caves were not the library where scrolls originally were placed, a fact that almost nobody ques- tions. What were the exact circumstances by which the scrolls arrived at the caves and what was their original context are the next key questions. Instead of con- cluding with the true and simple answer that "We don't know," Hirschfeld invents a story that is on the verge of science fiction and reads like a novel. He suggests that the owners of the library, Sadducees in his opinion, decided to take the scrolls out from "the doomed city to someone close to them, apparently of the same so- cial status, the owner of the estate at Qumran. He may have also supplied the jars in which some of the scrolls were found ... we can imagine that a whole convoy of pack animals was needed to deliver them to Qumran. The owner of Qumran, probably familiar with the area, helped locate the most suitable caves in which to conceal the scrolls. . . ." (243). All that is needed to add is that this took place in the middle of the night under the pale light of the moon.... Hirschfeld's next challenge is the Essense identification with the DSS sect. Hirschfeld excavated twenty-eight poor cells next to ancient cultivated terraces at a distance of 200 meters from Ein Gedi. Based on a combination of reading two first-century CE records-though not eyewitness-Philo and Pliny the Elder, he suggests that these cells were the home of the Essenes. The cells (most probably shelter for seasonal workers) look poor enough to Hirschfeld to be identified with the description of the Essenes by Philo. Pliny the Elder provides the location: "be- low the mountains of Ein Gedi." While Philo's tendency toward overstating is well attested, the sources of Pliny the Elder remain a mystery. Some suggest that he accompanied Vespasian, and others suggest that he derived his information from Roman military records.2 Pliny also errs elsewhere. Out of the four places he men- tions around the Sea of Galilee, only two are placed correctly. Therefore Pliny should not be taken as reliable evidence. In sum, the accepted identification of the DSS sect and the Essenes still holds fast. Except for minor historical inaccuracies and a mild polemical tone, the book is nicely written, illustrated with high-quality, full-page photographs, numerous drawings and plans that clearly enhance the text. To sum up, Hirschfeld's most important achievement is that he thinks out- side the box. This is the right recipe for scholarly progress. Challenging confor- mity is an important merit and the courage to speak up is valuable. However, much more work still needs to be done if one wishes to collapse the standard theory sur- 2. Mark D.
