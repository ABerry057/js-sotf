<plain_text><page sequence="1">PIERCING THE SHIMMERING BUBBLE: DAVID SHAHAR'S THE PALACE OF SHATTERED VESSELS by GILEAD MORAHG All things are interrelated. I can hardly open my mouth to speak with- out feeling as though the sea burst its dams and overflowed. How shall I express what my soul received, how can I put it down in a book? Isaac Luria Within the steadily growing body of fiction written by David Shahar over the past three decades, his trilogy of novels, The Palace of Shattered Vessels,' stands out as his most remarkable achievement to date. It is a com- plex, often puzzling work, steeped in the spirit of Jerusalem, in which it is set, bold in the narrative techniques it employs, and ambitious in its themat- ic aspirations. The trilogy is developed through what initially appears to be 1. David Shahar, Heikhal ha-Kelim ha-Shevurim: KayiZ be-Derekh ha-Nevi'im (Tel Aviv: 1969); Ha-Massa' le-Ur Kasdim (Tel Aviv, 1971); Yom ha-Rozenet (Tel Aviv, 1976). At the time of their writing Shahar regarded these three novels as integrated components of a com- pleted work and described Yom ha-Rozenet as "the novel that concludes my trilogy" (interview with Moshe Dor, Ma'ariv, June 26, 1979). He has since changed his original conception and is planning to add three more novels to the series. The first of these has already been published: Ningal (1983). This novel is so loosely and tangentially related to its three predecessors that it does not impinge upon the structural and thematic integrity of the original trilogy. This essay will address itself only to the first three novels, which continue to constitute a self-contained narrative whole. 211</page><page sequence="2">212 GILEAD MORAHG a meandering stream of fragmented memories flowing through the mind of its unnamed narrator. As the flow continues, these fragments gradually cohere into broad arcs of interlocking narrative circles that effect a vivid evocation of Jerusalem and its inhabitants as they were in the early decades of this century. But The Palace of Shattered Vessels aims at being much more than a memorial tribute to a nearly forgotten era in a rapidly changing city. Shahar's retrospective and digressive technique is both the outcome and the means of his pursuit of metaphysical discoveries and of his attempt to relate these discoveries to the physical reality he evokes in his fiction. His technique enables him to recreate the minutiae of a perceived phenomenal reality-of the world as it is perceived by the senses-in a manner that seeks to subvert our habitual perceptions of this reality and lead to an awareness of what he regards as the transcendent essences that lie beyond it. Although some of the critics who have addressed themselves to The Palace of Shattered Vessels note Shahar's concern with transcendent reality, few have chosen to pursue this aspect of his work and thus to explore its cru- cial role in the trilogy.2 The objective of this essay is to examine the relation- ship between the metaphysical orientation of the trilogy and the structural principles that bind its seemingly random elements into a signifying design. Much of my effort will be directed toward identifying and deciphering the concepts, patterns, and narrative dynamics that are central to the develop- ment of The Palace of Shattered Vessels. The fragmented and digressive progression of the narrative will sometimes make it necessary to demon- strate the subtle connections between its various elements by tracing them in considerable detail. In attempting to do so I will, of necessity, disregard much of the work's rich eposidic scope and many of the vital characters that populate it. I will concentrate only on those aspects that best serve to estab- lish the metaphysical orientation of the trilogy and to illuminate the rela- 2.

What I am about to propose is not a comprehen- sive interpretation of The Palace of Shattered Vessels but rather a conceptual framework that may aid future readers in engaging the intricacies of this tantalizing and elusive work. Contrary to many contemporary critical opinions, David Shahar believes that literature should be referential to the world outside it.3 He is very explicit in regarding phenomenal reality and transcendent reality as the essential referents for all good literary art. He is equally explicit in his claim that the role of literature is to provide meaning to reality by pursuing the connection between the phenomenal world and the transcendent realms that lie beyond it. "In my opinion," he has said, good literature of reality is literature that deals with the true essence of reality, namely, with that which is beyond reality.... The importance of a writer's work is in that increment of what is beyond reality, to the extent that it pro- vides meaning to reality .... I believe that literature seeks the connection between the transient and that which is beyond it.... Every person feels that there is something that exists beyond the transient and the apparent. Litera- ture deals with this context.4 Regardless of whether we accept the validity of this normative dictum, it should be recognized as an expression of Shahar's personal credo as a liter- ary artist and, consequently, as a useful point of departure for an examina- tion of his work. The Palace of Shattered Vessels embodies a quest for the connection between the transient and the transcendent. The narrator of the work is identified as its author, who is conducting this quest by writing the trilogy. The process of reconstructing past experiences by means of which the narra- tor pursues his metaphysical quest involves the integration of three separate narrative perspectives. The recalled perspective of the narrator as a child provides much of the narrative material in the trilogy. These childhood memories are often supplemented by later recollections of the narrator as an adult who in the course of time has acquired new information about the events of the past and a more up-to-date knowledge about the fate of the 3.

The mutually enriching interaction between the narrator's childhood recollections and the recollections of his related experiences as an adult serves to make many of the factual, chrono- logical, and motivational connections in the narrative. But it soon becomes evident that these two perspectives do not allow the narrator to perceive the more essential connection between the ever-changing flow of recollected events and the constant presence of the transcendent reality that lies beyond them. The capacity to attain such perception is attributed to the intrinsically different perspective of the narrator as a writer who draws upon the other two perspectives in order to create a work of literary art. On various occasions the narrator refers to his role as the author of the trilogy. He rejoices when a chance encounter provides him with additional information about one of the trilogy's minor characters "at the very time when I am writing about these matters."5 He complains when a seemingly irrevelant question about another character "arose in my mind while I was writing ... and began bothering me so much that I was unable to continue the story until I had checked the matter in the catalogue of the National Library" (III, 54). Interrupting his writing and setting out to conduct this bit of research, the narrator realizes that he is incapable of "enjoying the reality of the present if the now that is here is cut off from the resonance of what was and the yearning for what will be, if my spirit is not free to continue the weaving of the story whose chords are stretched between the past and the future, and if I am unable to return at will to the desk so as to continue writ- ing this story" (III, 58).6 5.

The matter of the fictional authorship of the trilogy is complicated by the narrator's early and obscure reference to Gabriel Luria, one of the work's major characters, as "the author of The Palace of Shattered Vessels" (I, 19). This assertion is contradicted by the subsequent deve- lopment of the narrative, and I was interested to note that it had been omitted from both the English and French translations of the first volume. Upon discovering this omission, I wrote to Shahar suggesting that "this was not an inadvertent omission but rather a correction made nec- essary by the manner in which the narrative developed in the course of writing the second and third volumes." Could it be, I asked, that "the continuation and conclusion of your literary journey turned out to be different from what you had anticipated at its outset? I have a feeling that your writing of The Palace of Shattered Vessels involved as many discoveries, illuminations and changes of direction as those experienced by its readers." To which Shahar responded rather laconically in a letter dated July 2, 1982: "Your assumption is correct: I myself erased the sentence attributing the authorship to Gabriel Luria from the English and French translations, and this-among other reasons-in order to prevent, as much as possible, unnecessary and confusing difficulties."</page><page sequence="5">PIERCING THE SHIMMERING BUBBLE 215 The major distinction between the perspective of the narrator as a writer and the perspectives of his childhood and adult experiences is established in the opening episode that sets the trilogy into motion. This episode depicts the narrator's first encounter with Gabriel Jonathan Luria, the character who will come to embody the quest for transcendent awareness and whose presence dominates the first volume of the trilogy and permeates its sequels. Recounted from the perspective of the child, this encounter occurs while the narrator is in his yard drawing water from a cistern that is a constant source of anxiety for him: "On nights when the rain came down hard I would be filled with fear that the cistern, unable to contain the abundance of water flowing ceaselessly into it, would burst and we would all be drowned."7 On the day of their meeting this fear was dispelled by "the reassuring radiance emanating from Gabriel Jonathan Luria, from his countenance, from his voice and, strangest of all, even from his words, which in their content should have served not to bestow calm but just the opposite-to confirm the dim apprehension, to clarify it, and to intensify it into a basic cosmic dread: ... 'Yes, yes, the vessels will never be able to contain the abundance"' (I, 10-11, 3-4). Shortly after this the narrative perspective shifts to a recollec- tion of a much later encounter between the narrator, now an adult, and Gabriel. By this time Gabriel's eyes have become so sensitive that he is sometimes felled by a dazzling stroke of light and forced to lie flat on the couch with dark glasses over his closed eyes. It is after such an incident that the adult narrator encounters Gabriel, who, pointing to his eyes, repeats what he said twenty years earlier: "The vessels will never be able to contain the abundance" (I, 12, 5). Here the narrative perspective shifts once again to that of the narrator as writer, who observes that at the time of the second encounter he had "failed to see the connection between the cistern which could not contain the water and [Gabriel's] eyes which could no longer bear the abundance of light" (I, 12, 5). The connection that was missed by the narrator at the time of the event is established when, from his perspective as a writer, he recalls this event and 7.

All subsequent references to the first vol- ume of the trilogy, hereafter cited as I, will appear in the text followed by an italicized reference to the English translation of the book: The Palace of Shattered Vessels (Boston, 1975). In quot- ing from the first volume I have, for the most part, relied on its English translation. But the reader will find occasional discrepancies between the quoted translation and the translation that is referred to. These are my modifications that were made in those instances where I found the original translation to be deficient.</page><page sequence="6">216 GILEAD MORAHG discovers its analogical correspondences with an earlier occurrence. A com- plex pattern of such analogical connections among its diverse narrative components constitutes the structural mainstay of the trilogy and its major mode of transmuting matter into meaning. But in The Palace of Shattered Vessels, structure is inseparable from metaphysics. One of the basic princi- ples underlying the development of the trilogy is that the pattern of relation- ships among its narrative components should not be contrived by the writer but rather discovered by him. This principle assumes an a priori, nontem- poral pattern of significant relations that exist among the phenomena of a physical world but are obscured by our habitual mode of perceiving reality as a linear flow of events in time. In writing the trilogy the narrator is seek- ing a new mode of perception that will penetrate these barriers of time and place. By subsuming the seemingly disparate and transitory events of the past to the recollecting consciousness of the literary artist, the narrator seeks to assemble these fragments of memory into a unified pattern that will con- firm the insubstantiality of the transient and illuminate its connection with the transcendent. This, I believe, is what Shahar had in mind when he observed that "the material world is limited and the abundance which flows into the vessels shatters them,"' and described his writing as an attempt "to collect the fragments of these vessels, to make my reconstruction. I am try- ing to put the vessels together again in my own way."9 In describing his literary enterprise as an attempt to transcend the limita- tions of the material world by a narrative process of collecting and recon- structing fragments of broken vessels, Shahar is alluding to one of the major symbols of Lurianic Kabbalah. This is not a casual allusion. There is an evi- dent correspondence between Shahar's perception of reality and some of the central notions of Lurianic cosmology. Both share the essentially Neo- platonic conception of the material world as a debased, fragmented, and much diminished reflection of an original world of harmonious forms that are purely spiritual. They also share the vision of restoring the lost spiritual harmony through healing human actions. The visionary world of Lurianic Kabbalah provides a rich metaphorical matrix for the opening movements of The Palace of Shattered Vessels and is evident in many aspects of the trilogy's subsequent development. The signifying role of kabbalist references is indicated in the title of the 8. Hayim Be'er, "Shattered Vessels: An Interview with David Shahar," Ariel 30(1972): 15. 9.

As we have seen, it is Gabriel who relates the young narrator's dread of the over- flowing cistern, as well as the inability of his own eyes to withstand the influx of light, to the Lurianic image of the vessels shattered by the abun- dance of light flowing into them. The linking of the narrator and Gabriel to the image of the shattered vessels initiates a complex flow of ancillary meta- phorical constructs that enables the unfolding representation of Shahar's fundamental metaphysical stance. According to Lurianic cosmology, the nature of the archetypal forms in the created world was determined by the often antagonistic interaction between "the powers of stern justice," including the power of evil, and a resi- due of God's "infinite light."'2 In order to cleanse the elements of creation from the powers of evil, a ray of light emanated from the eyes of the Creator God. But the vessels of creation that were intended to receive and contain the light shattered under its impact, bringing into being the world of material forms. The breaking of the vessels is regarded as the decisive crisis which ultimately determined man's place in the cosmos. The perfect har- mony of the archetypal vessels was reduced to the present chaos of material fragments. Sparsely intermingled with these fragments are remanent sparks of the divine light. But these are largely obscured from the eyes of man, who is himself a shattered vessel living in a disjointed world where nothing remains as it was. But despite these deficiencies, man is regarded as an essen- tial agent in the next stage of the cosmic process, in which what has been broken is to be restored. The shattering effects of the superabundance of light are counteracted by a process of restoration (tikkun) initiated by the Creator God, from whose forehead have issued healing lights with the power of restoring the broken vessels to the original harmony of their defini- tive spiritual forms. But the crucial stages of this restorative mission are 10. For a discussion of the "Lurian" as a distinct genre, see Hillel Barzel, Mesapprim be- Yihudam (Tel Aviv, 1981), pp. 168-171. 11.

By engaging in an intricate process of eliminating the powers of evil or transforming them into powers of love and mercy, the individual may restore the pristine perfection of his own spiritual body and, ultimately, the spiritual body of creation. The Lurianic dialectic of light, which both shatters the vessels and embodies the potential for their eventual restoration, is incorporated into the figure of Gabriel Luria and constitutes one of the central metaphorical constructs underlying The Palace of Shattered Vessels. One of the kabbalist synonyms for the breaking of the vessels is "blinding,"'3 and Gabriel, whose eyes "could no longer bear the abundance of the light," is a victim of such blinding. But he is also a source of "reassuring radiance" that emanates from his countenance and dispells the young narrator's elemental dread. Gabriel's search for a liberating vision leads him to a small village in Brit- tany where he eventually experiences a revelatory removal of "the curtain from before his eyes" and is blinded by the "terrible and wondrous light" that was heretofore hidden by the obscuring forms of the material world. He is suffused with "a wave of wonderful happiness flooding through him and carrying him toward the secret written in the sky . . . for all to see" (I, 195, 178). Even the realization that he may "never be able to decipher a single shining letter of a single luminous word in all the scrolls that every eye can see, could not dim the terrible light that was revealed with the falling away of a single panel from the dividing curtain" (I, 198, 180). Returning to Jeru- salem, Gabriel proclaims that "the world is out of tune" (III, 127) and dedicates himself to the restoration of harmony both in his own life and in the life of the world around him. Gabriel is the most explicit embodiment of Shahar's conception of art as a possible means of liberating the individual from the temporal trap of the material world by actualizing the latent potential for transcendent aware- ness. Upon his return to Jerusalem, Gabriel engages in a mysterious writing project. When asked by Orita why he writes as he does, Gabriel invokes the Aristotelian notion of poetry as a means of creating a temporal sequence in which the teleological potential inherent in the phenomenal world is utterly realized.14 "This is a metaphysical question," he says. "It is the problem of the transition from the potential to the actual" (II, 192). 13. Harold Bloom, Kabbalah and Criticism (New York, 1975), p. 77. 14.

Many of the narrative's diverse components lead up to her creation, contribute to her development, and cohere in the final sequence of her actions. Shoshi is the embodiment of what may be regarded as Shahar's interpretation of the Lurianic notion of tikkun.: the restoration of spiritual grace through redeeming human actions. Ventur- ing into the world from the orphanage in which she grew up, Shoshi soon discovers that the world outside the walls is no different from the world within them. Feeling like a "prisoner released from bondage only to dis- cover that she has gone from a small prison to a larger one which surrounds it all around" (III, 117), she embarks on a quest for freedom which is the central action of the final movement of the trilogy. After many years and several false starts, Shoshi recognizes the error of her having married a thoroughly repulsive man in order to realize her dream of freedom by obtaining a house of her own. In a moment of illumination, Shoshi discovers that her true course lies not in preserving the material security provided by her husband but in pur- suing the spiritual awakening proffered by his brother, the impoverished poet Berel Raban ("Eshbaal Ashtarot"). An inadvertent encounter with Berel's "Poems of Tammuz to the Ashera" pierces her very being "like a jet of shimmering sun rays," dispelling the darkness of the world that till then had encircled her "like a stifling prison" (III, 163). She realizes that the success of her quest depends upon her ability to take the radical action necessary for joining Berel's world to her own. Giving voice to this dis- covery of the connection between spiritual redemption and individual action, Shoshi employs a variety of kabbalist tropes that relate her newly found vision to the Lurianic notion of tikkun. Shoshi realizes the futility of waiting passively for the "holy spirit" to reveal itself to Berel and instruct him with "a voice sounding out of the silence, saying, 'Arise, go forth from your home and from your bed to the house which I shall show you ... there you shall seek, and there you shall find her whom your soul hath loved' " (III, 227-228). She concludes that it is she who must take action and initiate contact. For, as she says, echoing the Lurianic conception of individual responsibility for redeeming actions, "it is known that the holy spirit requires help from the individual: the deeds of the individual will draw her near, and the deeds of the individual will fend her off. She will have nothing to do with flesh and blood unless the individ- ual prepares for her by good deeds that are the channels for her coming" (III, 228).</page><page sequence="10">220 GILEAD MORAHG In kabbalist cosmology, channels (;innorot) are "paths of reciprocal influence""' between the ten sefirot that constitute "the potencies and modes of action of the living God."l6 The totality of these potencies "forms the world of. . . the unfolding divine unity which embraces the archetypes of all being.""7 With the breaking of the vessels the harmony of reciprocal emana- tions among the sefirot was disrupted; the channels were subverted and obstructed. Alluding to Lurianic depictions of the relations among the lower sefirot as a sexual union between male and female forces, Shoshi regards her anticipated union with Berel as an act of opening the channel that serves as a conduit for the reciprocal flow of vitalizing and harmonizing abundance that connects the created with the divine.'8 "First we must do the deed," Shoshi says to herself, "and only after the deed is done will the cavern be pierced and the channel open and abundance abound from all the spheres. Until Shoshi does the deed no heavenly voice will sound and reach Berel's ears from the silence" (III, 228). Shoshi is the only character in the trilogy who finds the strength and the means to transform vision into action. In so doing she experiences a sudden dissipation of fear and a liberating sense of transcendent harmony and grace. From the moment Shoshi dared and did the deed she no longer feared any- thing, and nothing seemed to her extraordinary or surprising; on the contrary, everything fit perfectly into the logic of the revolution she had brought about in her life, the revolution that opened the way for the holy spirit to bestow upon her and upon Eshbaal Ashtarot great abundance from all the spheres- everything within her and from without her flashed sparks of ancient secret meaning above and beyond the facts themselves, without any connection to the realm of events and to its limited and limiting rules, all in all from all in all. (III, 229-230) Shoshi's epiphany is at the heart of the trilogy's closing movement. The idiom, cadence, and substance of this epiphany exemplify the sustained association between the fictional world of The Palace of Shattered Vessels and the visionary world of Isaac Luria and his disciples.

Like the characters of Gabriel Luria, Shoshi Raban, and a great many others, the references to the Kabbalah-and to a number of other cosmological and metaphysical systems-serve to advance the creation of a fictional narrative by means of which the narrator as writer conducts a very personal quest for illumination and redemption. The three narrative perspectives-in the trilogy reflect different stages in the development of a single consciousness in its perception of and reaction to the connection between the transient and the transcendent. The perspec- tive of the narrator as writer is the last and most essential stage in this deve- lopment. To better understand its role in the narrative, we must turn to a further examination of the two earlier stages on which the writer's perspec- tive depends. Such an examination will reveal a crucial difference. As a child the narrator was capable of experiencing perceptions of transcendent reality but was incapable of comprehending the true implications of these experi- ences and of adequately connecting them to the reality of his everyday world. As an adult he becomes capable of hypothesizing a beneficient con- nection between the two realms of existence but no longer possesses the child's ability to experience the transcendent dimensions of reality, and thus he cannot substantiate this hypothesis in the mundane comings and goings of his daily life. Early in his life the narrator is awakened to a sense of the insignificance and vulnerability of human existence in relation to the palpable presence of essences that transcend this existence. This first occurs when, as a young child, he is taken out by Gabriel to view the world at night. It is an unnerv- ing and terrifying experience. The first meeting with the night shocked me and filled me with muffled dread. I saw the sky and suddenly it was black with tiny points of light in it.... The Old City walls and the mountains around them, the Mount of Olives and Mount Scopus, were present in the darkness and heavy with the weight of an ancient-breathed essence, terrible in its dimensions that are beyond the dimen- sions of man, in its eternities which are beyond the eternities of man, and in its indifference to the paltry people scurrying upon it. (I, 13, 5-6) In this early episode the connection between the transient and the transcen- dent is perceived as an ominous opposition between the mortal paltriness of</page><page sequence="12">222 GILEAD MORAHG man and the terrible dimensions of vast, mysterious forces that are beyond him. In several later instances actual encounters with the vulnerability of the human body and the transience of human life heighten the child's uneasy awareness of the transcendent dimensions of reality. One such instance occurs as he is bending over the dead body of Daoud, the vainglorious chauffeur who joined the Arab marauders and was killed by Gabriel. Peering into the dust-covered "singular face that was unique to Daoud," the boy experiences a revelation of "something deep inside it that was above and beyond it, a chord that was nothing but a tiny drop in the vastness of the general and indifferent sea that arises in sharp anger and ter- rible fury to drown us all" (III, 139). This and other, similar experiences serve to enhance the child's terrified sense that man is an insignificant mortal creature tenuously existing amidst ineffable forces that constantly threaten to engulf and annihilate him. The terror he experiences on such occasions is identified elsewhere with "the terror of the other reality that sur- rounds the world of appearances as the great sea engulfs the ship whose prow dares to cleave the swirling foam that laps at her stern" (I, 63, 46- emphasis added). In his terror, the child responds to these experiences by attempting to deny their validity and to reject their implications. The threat that they pose to the world as he knows it is so great that his rejection pre- vails even when an encounter with the vulnerable fragility of the flesh inti- mates the possibility of going beyond the limitations of the physical body and experiencing a more auspicious connection between the transient and the transcendent. During a visit to Dr. Landau's eye-clinic, the child encounters a boy whose eye has been mutiliated. The sight of the crushed eye confirms to the child "how vulnerable is this vessel of flesh" which he still regards as the "only means of revealing to us the light of the entire world." He elaborates on this conviction by describing the eye as "this ball of flesh on which the pleasure, that is so spiritual, of the light with all its shades and colors, so miraculously depends." But suddenly he experiences a contrary thought, or sensation, which suggests that neither the means nor the objects of percep- tion are exclusively physical: "However, a thought did arise in me, a kind of flickering feeling, that there may exist sensations and feelings and visions and melodies that are not of this world and do not require the mediation of the body." To the child this is an intolerable possibility, and he recoils from it in terror: "The possibility of such an indefinite, disembodied presence hovering in a vacuum between nothingness and nothingness terrified me so much that I repressed it at once and opened my two eyes wide with a sense of wonderful relief that they were both healthy and whole" (III, 34). The fleet-</page><page sequence="13">PIERCING THE SHIMMERING BUBBLE 223 ing vision of the possible existence of a realm of abundant experience that lies beyond the world of appearances, hidden from man's physical percep- tions yet accessible to him by other means, is not pursued. It is rejected in favor of a hasty retreat to the familiar world of the senses which, as Gabriel had observed to the then uncomprehending narrator, consists of vessels that cannot contain the abundance. As mentioned above, the consciousness of the narrator as an adult differs from that of the child in that as an adult he accepts the concept of transcendent reality but is incapable of experiencing it directly. He no longer insists on the exclusivity of the physical and regards the flesh and blood of the corporeal body as "the gross matter in which the soul garbs itself in the material world" (I, 141, 122). Unlike the child, who rejected the transcen- dent insight he experienced at the moment of Daoud's death, the adult describes the death of Gabriel's father as the moment in which the soul leaves the body, its material garment (III, 25). He is concerned with the problem of understanding the truth of "the connection between the flesh and the spirit" (III, 33) and ascribes his failure to arrive at such an under- standing to the fact that, having lost its childhood capacity to experience transcendence, his conciousness is confined to the nonessential world of appearances. The narrator conceives the dichotomy between his consciousness as a child and as an adult in terms of an opposition between two disparate states of the soul: "the consciousness of the soul in sleep" and "the consciousness of the soul in waking." This hypothesis is a central key to understanding the thematic and structural development of The Palace of Shattered Vessels. It postulates that in the state of sleep our consciousness may enter into essen- tial levels of awareness, or existence, that are inaccessible to it when we are awake. As long as we are awake we are bound to the perceptions of the senses and to the constructs of the intellect, which provide us with an errone- ous and illusory sense of reality. "Whereas the reality of man in his sleep is the reality of the soul before birth and after death." This is the true reality, in the fullness of its transcendent dimensions, that is revealed to the soul when it is no longer attached to a physical body: before birth and after death. Inaccessible to us while we are awake, this reality may be penetrated and perceived in our sleep by our dreams. But only by "those that are of a cer- tain type, the type of dreams that even our forgetting them is not remem- bered" (I, 56-57, 41-42). By asserting the inability of the waking consciousness to recall the tran- scendent visions experienced in sleep, the hypothesis appears to have arrived at an ontological and epistemological dead end. That this is not so becomes</page><page sequence="14">224 GILEAD MORAHG evident in the following thought, which suggests that the limitations of the waking consciousness are not absolute; that it is possible to remember that which we are not even aware of having forgotten by altering our mode of waking perception, or, in the words of the narrator: "The remembering of the essential reality which is beyond the day and the night depends on the awakening of man's waking consciousness, an awakening from the reality of man in his waking state" (I, 57, 42-emphasis added). This awakening of the waking consciousness is an instance of profound enlightenment which bridges the gap between the world of transient appearances and the world of eternal essences. It should be "counted among such leaps over the void as the renewal of the world and illumination and birth and death" (I, 57, 42). Arriving at such an awakening is the objective of the narrator's literary enterprise and the reason for his constant recourse to his childhood memories. For childhood is regarded as a stage in which the boundaries between the two states of the soul are not yet fixed. Thus the child can experience the two levels of reality, which for the adult are so definitively separate, as being inextricably intertwined. The narrator states his belief that in childhood the gaping void between these two states of the soul, the void of death and birth, did not exist at all, and I would run back and forth between sleeping and waking and between waking and sleeping as from one room of an enchanted palace to another, bubbling with the joy of the wondrous surprises awaiting me in every corner and at the top of every flight of stairs. (I, 56, 41) Unlike the adult, for whom the moment of waking from sleep is a moment of acute anguish resulting from his abrupt separation from the world of essential reality, the child, who is not subject to such separation, always awakens with a sense of joy that is often attended by a powerful yet undefin- able yearning.'9 It is only from his perspective as an adult, who for over twenty-five years has been deprived of the capacity to awaken joyously, that the significance of this capacity and its attendant yearning is realized. He describes the pains of awakening as "a curse which was intended to teach me by the long and difficult road of suffering the meaning of the lost blessing of the joy of awakening that no longer exists except in the longing of memory and in the irrational hope that it will return one day" (I, 56, 41). The joy of 19. Ha-Massa' le-Ur Kasdim, pp. 157-158.</page><page sequence="15">PIERCING THE SHIMMERING BUBBLE 225 awakening is recognized as a manifestation of the child's ability to experi- ence the connection between the transient and the transcendent dimensions of reality and to move freely but uncomprehendingly between them. Such childhood experiences are identical in essence to the adult's forgotten dream experiences. But they differ from them in that while the dream experiences can never be remembered, the parallel childhood experiences can be. Memory is the means by which the writer revives these childhood experi- ences in the hope that the dynamics of their re-creation will lead to an awakening of his consciousness from "the routine of waking sleep in which we are all bound by our threefold'chains" (I, 121, 100). The role of memory as the key to unlocking the chains that confine him to the desultory world of appearances is revealed to the narrator in an epi- phanic experience of involuntary memory. This experience opens the way for his attempt to recapture the joy of awakening through a sustained act of creative recollection. Walking home one day, the adult narrator hears a familiar voice delivering a sermon over a car radio that had been turned on by one of the neighborhood boys. It is the voice of Israel Shoshan, the librarian of the narrator's childhood, who later converted and became a Cal- vanist clergyman. But at the time of the broadcast Israel Shoshan has been dead for over three months. Upon hearing the voice of the dead librarian "rising up as if from the depths of [his] childhood," the narrator experiences an acute realization of "the fragility of this world which is founded on the insubstantiality of the senses and bursts like a bubble only to return and rise again with all its illusory images like a shimmering bubble" (I, 149, 131). But in its subsequent development this experience leads the narrator to a heightened perception of the connection between the temporal world of fleeting appearances and a permanent, nontemporal reality that permeates and transcends it. These two levels of reality are no longer perceived as being discrete and contradictory but rather as interrelated and complementary. Moreover, memory is recognized as a means of perceiving the liberating connection between them. Turning to inform the boy of the speaker's iden- tity, the narrator sees in the boy's innocent, wondering eyes something which, while deepening within me the sense of the brittleness of this shimmering bubble of our world, also deepened in me-not by way of contradiction but by way of completion-the sense of the existence that continues its being through all the old bubbles that have already burst and all the bubbles that are yet to be born and that will bubble in the future .... [The boy] looked at me as if he</page><page sequence="16">226 GILEAD MORAHG were seeing me for the first time and out of his gaze there arose in me the memory of the first time I saw Gabriel Jonathan Luria on a great and strange day in my life. (I, 150, 132) Evoked by the innocent gaze of a child, this sudden memory of his first childhood encounter with Gabriel imbues the narrator with a sense of enduring presence and constitutes the opening movement of the trilogy which is to pursue the connection between this presence and the world of transience through an evocation and exploration of memories. Sarah Katz, who has written extensively on Shahar, attempts to account for the use of memory in The Palace of Shattered Vessels. She regards the author of the trilogy as a man who, "disappointed and dissatisfied with his sober, rational adult world, yearns for his childhood and tries to reconstruct its unique experiences and perceptions. He tries to capture all 'the bubbles that have burst' and to weave them together into a narrative fabric in order to preserve them ... if only as a 'reflection' of the world that was lost."20 This is a limited view of Shahar's narrative enterprise. For Shahar is as con- cerned with the future as he is with the past; he is concerned not so much with preserving the bubbles of appearance as with piercing these bubbles so as to arrive at a perception of that which endures beyond their passing and connects all that was with all that is yet to be. The adult narrator undertakes the retrospective re-creation and exploration of the physical and emotional terrain of his childhood experiences with a desire to keep his "spirit free to continue the weaving of the story whose chords are stretched between the past and the future" and with a determination to distill from the "resonance of what was" and the "yearning for what will be" (III, 58) an awareness of what always is. In his excellent study Time in Literature, Hans Meyerhoff observes that "the quest for disclosing some sense of continuity, identity and unity within the context of the personal past of the individual has engaged great literature everywhere."21 Meyerhoff identifies a group of important writers, includ- ing James Joyce, Marcel Proust, and Virginia Woolf, whose works may be regarded as forerunners of The Palace of Shattered Vessels. They all arrive at a sense of unity and continuity through the realization of the constancy of an essential reality that inheres in and transcends the fragmented flow of tran- 20.

Of such moments, she thought, the thing is made that endures.23 But of all its illustrious precursors, The Palace of Shattered Vessels bears the closest affinity to Proust's Remembrance of Things Past in its narrator's unflagging reliance on memory as the major means of pursuing his dream of unity and freedom. The use of memory in Shahar's trilogy is similar in many of its aspects to its use in Proust's work, but it is different in its ultimate objective.24 Whereas Proust explores memory in an attempt to discover the essential identity of the self, Shahar evokes memory as a means of relating the self to a greater, transcendent essence that lies beyond it. This difference may account for the difference in the position of the narrator in each of the works. In Remem- brance of Things Past the narrator is at the center; all things relate back to Marcel and contribute to his evolving awareness of his identity as a unique individual. In The Palace of Shattered Vessels the narrator is peripheral to the action. He is a recollecting and perceiving presence in a design that is larger than any individual. Despite this fundamental thematic difference, the narrative structure of the two works is strikingly similar, and the lessons learned from the study of Proust may serve to advance our understanding of Shahar. The basic narrative principle governing the development of both Remembrance of Things Past and The Palace of Shattered Vessels may be described as a chain reaction of recollections and observations triggered by a single memory which sets the narrative on a course that is subsequently shaped by the interactions among the other memories that it evokes. This key memory is an involuntary memory which Proust, following Bergson, 22. Ibid., pp. 42-54. 23. Virginia Woolf, To the Lighthouse (London, 1932), p. 163. 24. For a discussion of some of the similarities between The Palace of Shattered Vessels and Remembrance of Things Past, see Ada Zemah, "Kirvah Yeteirah," Molad 3 (1970).</page><page sequence="18">228 GILEAD MORAHG distinguished from the voluntary memories formed by the process of habit- ual repetition. Proust regards voluntary memory as the "memory of the intellect," which "preserves nothing of the past itself."25 For "the past is hid- den somewhere outside the realm, beyond the reach of the intellect, in some material object (in the sensation which that material object will give us) of which we have no inkling."26 Involuntary memory, which is called forth by a chance encounter with such an object, has the power to revive the past in all its "shape and solidity."27 Ada Zemah aptly describes this experience as "a sensation in the present which leads suddenly and in a rare moment of grace to a similar sensation that had been forgotten and became part of the past and, with its emergence in memory it shakes the person's entire being and revives within him an incident of his past life in its full reality."28 In Shahar's work as in Proust's, "involuntary memory is the prime moving force of the narrative."29 The digressive pattern of the trilogy is often the result of the narrator's willing submission to the dynamics of involuntary memory. He follows the flow of memories to wherever it may lead, discovering connec- tions and discerning signifying patterns as he goes along.3" Meyerhoff defines the experience of involuntary memory as "an act of creative recall" which reveals a sense of unity and continuity in "the fact that the different contents of one's memory belong together and that the recollection of a single, unique, event makes it possible to reconstruct one's entire lifetime. This means that the sum total of one's life is potentially co- 25. Marcel Proust, Remembrance of Things Past, rev. ed. (New York, 1981), vol. 1, p. 47. 26. Ibid., pp. 47-48. 27. Ibid., p. 51.

It corresponds closely to the method of mystical counterpoint developed by the thirteenth- century Spanish kabbalist Abraham Abulafia as a means of enhancing the soul's ability to per- ceive transcendent forms. Scholem describes Abulafia's method of dillug and kefi;a ("skip- ping" and "jumping") as "a very remarkable method of using associations as a way of meditation." It provides a system of broad rules within which the mind is encouraged to jump from one association to another. Every "jump opens a new sphere, defined by certain formal, not material characteristics." This "jumping ... results in a 'widening of consciousness' and brings to light hidden processes of the mind; it liberates us from the prison of the natural sphere and leads us to the boundaries of the divine sphere" [emphasis added] (Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, pp. 135-136).</page><page sequence="19">PIERCING THE SHIMMERING BUBBLE 229 present (or simultaneous) with this single event."3' In Remembrance of Things Past the recollection of eating the madeleine is the key to the recon- struction of Marcel's life.32 The key memory in Shahar's retrospective quest is, as we have already seen, the narrator's recollection of the first time he saw Gabriel. In the particulars of its depiction and the dynamics of its organiza- tion, this memory constitutes a generative nucleus which prefigures the unity and continuity of the narrative that emanates from it. The evocation of this nucleus releases the great flow of involuntary memory and shaping energy that will transform its compressed potential into expanding spirals of narra- tive action.33 The opening sentence of the trilogy introduces "the light and the water of the cistern and the mouth of the cave and the rock at its side" as the four sources of the "sensations of memory"34 that connect the narrator with the enigmatic figure of Gabriel Luria. Episodes and images that relate the four sources of memory to Gabriel are integrated into the opening chapter in a manner which establishes the function of the sensations of memory as a potential means to the end of dispelling the terror of transient existence by breaching the barriers of time and exceeding the limitations of the temporal self. A full account of the seminal role of the four sources of memory would require a comprehensive examination of the relationship between their depiction in the opening chapter and the overall development of the trilogy. Since such an examination deserves the scope of a separate study, my present purpose will be best served by singling out some aspects of the cis- tern and the cave. Memories of Gabriel are associated with the cistern because the narrator had been drawing water from it when Gabriel first appeared before him. Since that day, says the narrator, Gabriel's "figure was fixed in my memory as rising from the mouth of the cistern together with the pail of water ... I was pulling up with a peculiar kind of pleasure" (I, 9, 1). The memory of this occurrence not only sets the trilogy into motion but also reflects the essential dynamics and ultimate objectives of its subsequent development. There is an analogical correspondence between the process of drawing up water from 31. Meyerhoff, Time in Literature, p. 49. 32. Proust, Remembrance of Things Past, pp. 48-51. 33.

This important phrase is, unfortunately, lost in the English translation.</page><page sequence="20">230 GILEAD MORAHG the depths of the cistern and the process of drawing up memories from the depths of the psyche. Preparing to draw the water, the boy is confronted with a shimmering, self-reflecting surface that must be pierced: "I remove the lid and peer down at the surface of the dark water. The thin, protective film of kerosene is oily and sends shimmers of colorful lights like a halo around my head that rises from the water and hides their depths." Using his pail, the boy penetrates this resisting surface and plumbs the hidden depths beneath it: "With a sharp, vigorous motion I insert the light pail, that seeks to keep floating above, beneath the surface. The pail begins sinking under the weight of the water that fills it. I give it more and more rope." Having filled the pail, the boy begins drawing it up again. Once it "pierces the upper surface and rises in the narrow mouth of the cistern," its contents begin to spill out in "scattering drops that flash fragments of light all around." What has been gained is in danger of being fragmented and lost. Some of it is. Considerable skill is necessary to retain the remainder of the precious load and capture it in the awaiting vessels: "If I am not careful half the water will spill out by the time the pail is extracted from the mouth of the cistern. With a vigorous motion I pour the water into one of the.. . tall, pot-bellied water jars that stand in the kitchen" (I, 10, 2). There is little need to belabor the analogy between the depicted process of drawing up water and pouring it into jars and the creative process of drawing up memories and pouring their diffuse and elusive fragments into the shape-giving vessels of the narrative. But note should be taken of the fact that in the process of drawing water, the sense of existential dread that is usually associated with the cistern is replaced by "a peculiar kind pleasure" which is further enhanced by the calming effect emanating from Gabriel, whose reflected image appears in the water, replacing that of the narrator. This transformation prefigures the recurrent instances in the trilogy in which the experience of involuntary memory is accompanied by an onrush of sweet joy and a sense of great calm. On such occasions the narrator is overcome with awe and wonder which he often describes as a feeling of being suddenly transported to a supernal palace. The image of the palace combines the sensations of joy, calm, awe, and wonder to establish an essen- tial connection between the unifying power of memory and the childhood capacity to bridge the void between the two states of the soul and to "run back and forth between sleeping and waking . .. as from one room of an enchanted palace to another bubbling with joy" (I, 56, 41-emphasis added). In one representative instance the joyous sense of being introduced into a wondrous palace in which the scattered fragments of time suddenly cohere</page><page sequence="21">PIERCING THE SHIMMERING BUBBLE 231 into a nontemporal unity is evoked by the sight of Judge Gutkin seating himself in a red armchair. This sight triggers in the narrator a palpable recollection of Gabriel's father, the now deceased Bey, who used to sit in the same chair. The picture of the old Bey, as I had last seen him before his death, sitting on this red armchair with the checked scarf . . . wrapped around his neck ... superimposed itself on the picture of the judge sitting on the same verandah in the same armchair without either picture blotting the other out, blurring or erasing its lines in the slightest degree, and my heart expanded in joyful wonder and awe in the palace in which I suddenly found myself standing. (I, 102, 82-emphasis added) The power of memory to dispel existential dread by reorienting one's waking perception of the mysteries of existence is confirmed somewhat later when the texture and odor of a moldy old dagger evoke another involun- tary memory. Once again the narrator feels as if he is in a "palace" and is filled with a sense of uncomprehending wonder. But "the sense of the enigma posed by this uncomprehending wonder was not accompanied by any of the anxiety or strain usually involved in the search for a solution to a riddle. On the contrary, the very act of wondering about the meaning of the enigma was in itself imbued with a marvelously pleasant sensation" (I, 112, 94-emphasis added). The qualities of the enigma that were so incomprehensible to the narra- tor as a child become more apparent to him as a writer immersing himself in the flow of memory. As memories breed memories, their discrete fragments merge into intertwining narrative spirals and their chronological moorings begin to unravel. Freed by memory from the constraints of time, events of the past become alive in the present, intimating that time is but an illusion and what appeared to be transient is actually constant. The narrator realizes that a sense of the past is created not by the actual passing of events but by the limits of our perception. He concludes that, in certain circumstances, experiences and events which we regard as having passed into oblivion arise before us like Lazarus from the dead, to prove to us that their being dead to us was merely the result of the narrowness of the lantern's beam of light that illuminates only a portion of the dirt track on which we walk through the great and broad field that lies entirely apart from us because of the curtain of dark- ness that excludes all its vistas from our field of vision, even when its abysses gape inside us. (I, 118, 97)</page><page sequence="22">232 GILEAD MORAHG The resurrecting circumstances of expanded vision are moments of involun- tary memory in which the dark curtain of chronological time is pierced and the wide expanses beyond it are revealed. In Shahar's work, as in Proust's, "the twinge of involuntary memory is portrayed as surmounting contin- gency by an act that is not continuous with la duree but overleaps it."35 Winding his way through the labyrinth of memory, the narrator experi- ences a recollection that intimates the hidden dimensions of reality and the nontemporal constancy of existence. He remembers the moment Israel Shoshan appeared on his doorstep, as if out of nowhere: At the sight of the bespectacled little man standing at the door, "my distant childhood days, which no longer exist except in occasional dreams or in passing thoughts, crystalized into tangible form ... as if they had been existing all these years in the substance of the material world, but in a different place which imbues them with a different quality" (I, 118, 97-98). This recollection lays the ground for a subsequent recollection which superimposes itself on the memory of Dr. Shoshan's visit and connects him with the anonymous fig- ure whose passing presence became fixed in the narrator's mind on a day of routine military duty. At such times the sense of his dismal existence as a prisoner of material reality and chronological time was most acute. "As usual ... time dragged on interminably in the insipid greyness of tangible external actions" (I, 121, 100). This feeling changes abruptly when the dim figure of an unknown man emerges from a gate in the wall surrounding a nearby hospital. Suddenly this moment is "torn free from the continuum of time." This moment appeared before me like the vision of an orange sunset sky in which everything-the stone wall and the treetops beyond it and the dirt track and the black figure of the man-was immersed in a strange, wonderful, and abundant calm which was fixed and unchanging and existing as it is outside the course of time like a picture in a museum which you can go back to one day and find it exactly as it was when the artist finished painting it, without fear that any change had taken place in the landscape in the course of the moments of time. (I, 121, 100-emphasis added) The dark figure disappears around a corner and the vision fades. But when the narrator returns to the normal course of time he is still imbued with "the 35. Shattuck, Marcel Proust, p. 145.</page><page sequence="23">PIERCING THE SHIMMERING BUBBLE 233 strange, wonderfully calming, and spiritually uplifting flavor of this certainty that it was possible to return to this orange moment of spacious sunset that is detached from the race of time" (I, 122, 100-emphasis added). This instance constitutes a signal moment of illumination in which the capacity of memory to convert the perception of time from an ever-changing sequence of transient events to the eternal constancy of enduring presences is integral- ly connected to the great calm and sudden joy associated with instances of transcendent awareness.36 As is the case with so many other aspects of the trilogy, the essential con- nection between memory, time, and transcendence is also prefigured in the opening chapter. Like the cistern, the caves of the Sanhedrin are designated as one of the four sources of the childhood memories associated with Gabriel. It was Gabriel who used to lead the narrator to the caves, encour- age him to descend into their dark depths, and dispel his fear of the disem- bodied spirits and creeping vermin that might lurk there. The boy would leap into the mouth of the cave trembling with the pleasure of anticipating the discovery of "the treasure hidden in the secret world of the caves." He knew that all the artifacts had been plundered from these burial caves long ago, but was convinced that "the treasure itself, buried deep down, remained as it was, just as the burial niches are the same niches from those days with their being of stone which remained as a preserve of time in a pre- serve of space." This eternal constancy of time and space is the treasure hidden in the depths of the cave, which, like the depths of memory, serve as a brake on the wheel of time. For the cave is like a brake holding back the wheel of time in its revolutions, and in the depths of darkness beyond the niches of the dead its braking action is so strong that fragments of time that were torn from their wheel cling to their brake and flutter around it with their living and their dead. (I, 17-18, 10-11) By descending into the depths of memory, the narrator discovers the hidden treasure. The sensations of memory have the power to free him from his 36. It should be noted that in Remembrance of Things Past, the experience of involuntary memory is also attended by a surge of "all-powerful joy" that transports the narrator above the malaise of his temporal existence: "An exquisite pleasure had invaded my senses .... And at once the vicissitudes of life had become indifferent to me, its disaster innocuous, its brevity illusory.... I had ceased to feel mediocre, contingent, mortal" (Proust, p. 48).</page><page sequence="24">234 GILEAD MORAHG bondage to chronological time by showing it to be yet another illusory dimension of the world of appearances. His habitual perception of time as a linear sequence of finite events and his corollary terror of the transient are, at such moments, replaced by a serene awareness of time as an eternal con- stant in which the past is superimposed upon the present-just as the figure of the dead Bey was superimposed on that of the living Judge-and is part of the infinity of the future.37 As separate occurrences, the instances of involuntary memory are but fragmentary illuminations of the greater reality that lies beyond the illusion of appearances, largely obscured by the limitations of the waking conscious- ness. The narrator seeks to further overcome these limitations by integrating the shattered vessels of memory into the unified structure of a narrative design. The writing of The Palace of Shattered Vessels is undertaken in the belief that sustained creative recall is a liberating act that may lead to the awakening of consciousness to an awareness of the reality that lies beyond the dimensions of time. An understanding of the conceptual and structural principles governing the development of the narrative should enhance our ability to explore the digressive patterns and signifying connections in the complex world of the trilogy. But in addition to enabling further analysis and interpretation, such understanding may lead to a greater openness to the actual experience of reading the trilogy. For, as Shahar would surely agree, The Palace of Shattered Vessels is intended for those readers who, by immersing themselves in the experiences that advance the awakening of the narrator's consciousness, might experience a similar awakening of their own.
