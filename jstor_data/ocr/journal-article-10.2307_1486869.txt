<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS David Marcus. From Balaam to Jonah: Anti-Prophetic Satire in the Hebrew Bible. Brown Judaic Studies 301. Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1995. xiii, 214 pp. This work examines four stories in the Hebrew Bible which appear to be "critical of prophets, and which may be called anti-prophetic satires" (p. vii). Under David Marcus's microscope are four biblical narratives: Balaam and his donkey (Numb 21:21-35), the boys and the bald prophet (2 Kgs 2:23-25), the lying prophet (1 Kgs 13), and Jonah. Marcus defines satire as a story that has a recognizable direct or indirect "object of attack" (p. 9) and that contains an overwhelming abundance of satirical features, including "a mixture of unbelievable elements (absurdities, fantastic situations, grotesqueries, distortions), ironies, ridicule, parody, and rhetorical features" (ibid.). As to why these texts (and many others) have not been examined as satires previously, Marcus credits the general lack of references to biblical stories in standard textbooks on satire, the humorless reverence for the Bible held by generations of faith groups, and changing social and historical conditions which led later readers to become unaware of the targets of biblical satire. Marcus's arguments are lucid and convincing, and his examination contains copious insightful philological notes and supporting references to talmudic and medieval commentaries. In addition to demonstrating the presence of each of the characteristic features of satire, Marcus shows how only satire can explain the more problematic aspects of the four texts. For example, the horrific account of Elisha summoning wild bears to maul forty-two children simply for calling him "baldy" (2 Kgs 2:23-25) cannot be explained simply by saying that God has a severe attitude toward prophet-mockers. Similarly, we cannot understand why the Ninevite cattle fast and don sackcloth (Jonah 3:8) without appealing to the notion of satire. This work is so well argued that it naturally spurs the question whether other prophetic satires can be found in the Bible. For example, if we employ 103</page><page sequence="2">104 BOOK REVIEWS Marcus's criteria, we might add the stories about Elijah in 1 Kings 17-18. They contain all of the requisite satirical elements, including irony (e.g., Yahweh brings the rain for which the prophets of Baal prayed [1 Kgs 18:45]), fantastic situations involving animals (e.g., ravens bringing Elijah his breakfast [1 Kgs 17:6]), grotesquerie (e.g., Elijah slaughters four hundred prophets of Baal who have just gashed themselves with flints [1 Kgs 18:40]), vulgarity and ridicule (e.g., Elijah using the word "pissing"I while mocking the prophets [1 Kgs 18:27]), distortion (e.g., the Zarephathite widow's unending supply of oil and flour [1 Kgs 17:16]), parody (e.g., Baal's prophets proclaim Yahweh as the only God [1 Kgs 18:39]), and numerous rhetorical features. There is, however, one problematic aspect of this work: Marcus's assertion that the principal message of these texts (with the possible exception of Numb 21:21-35) is not an ideological one, but solely the negative portrayal of the prophets' behavior (pp. 157-158). The two types of message are not mutually exclusive, for as even Marcus notes, beneath these satires "there lies the unspoken wish of what the proper behavior should be" (p. 170). In addition, it is doubtful that the authors of these stories would have distinguished between ideological and behavioral assessment. Witness, for example, the story of David and Bathsheba (2 Sam 11-12), which is at once critical of David's behavior and yet nevertheless still conveys a theological/ideological message: "even the king, if he sins, cannot escape God's punishment." It is difficult to see how the prophetic satires differ in this regard. Moreover, the notion that ideology lies beneath these satires concurs with what Marcus cites as the most frequent form of irony in the Bible, "measure for measure" irony (p. 16). This form of irony, which also obtains in the four stories, is clearly ideological.2 Thus, the distinction raised by Marcus remains unclear. One last comment: Though he does not mention it, Marcus's discussion of the Balaam narrative raises the issue of how to understand the Transjordanian Balaam texts from Deir 'Alla. Are they satires too, or the source material for the Bible's satire? One would like to see Marcus's view on this, at least in a footnote. These minor criticisms aside, this is a fascinating and convincing book.
