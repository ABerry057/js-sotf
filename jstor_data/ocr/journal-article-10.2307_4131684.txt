<plain_text><page sequence="1">Adam S. Ferziger. Exclusion and Hierarchy: Orthodoxy, Nonobservance, and the Emergence of Modern Jewish Identity. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2005. x, 303 pp. As recently as a generation ago, the scholarly study of Orthodox Judaism was at its very beginning. In the intervening years, research has proceeded at a rapid pace, and we now have expert analyses of a wide range of topics relating to Orthodoxy, examined from a number of different angles. Indeed, the study of Orthodoxy can almost be regarded as its own field. Adam S. Ferziger's new book is a worthy addition to this growing corpus, and he has given us a very readable and intelligent study of Orthodoxy in modem times. In this work, he analyzes the relationship of the Orthodox rabbinic elite to the nonobservant. That is, he shows how Orthodoxy was able to come to terms with the nonobservant, and by the mid-nineteenth century, we find outstanding rabbinic figures arguing that the nonobservant should not be viewed as outcasts, as was understandably the earlier approach, but rather as sinning members of the Jewish collective. This was a significant development because according to 464</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews the Talmud and premodern authorities, a Sabbath violator is to be regarded in many respects as no different from a Gentile. What makes Ferziger's study unique is not the material examined, for a number of other scholars have also analyzed these sources, but the approach he brings to the task. Using sociological models, Ferziger attempts to place the phenomena he is describing into a wider religious and sociological context. Beginning in the early eighteenth century, he surveys a number of important proto-Orthodox and Orthodox figures, such as Zvi Hirsch Ashkenazi, Jacob Emden, Ezekiel Landau, Moses Sofer, Akiva Eger, Jacob Ettlinger, Seligmann Baer Bamberger, Samson Raphael Hirsch, Esriel Hildesheimer, and David Zvi Hoffmann (unfortunately misspelled as Hoffman throughout the book). Ferziger is able to show how these figures dealt with the nonobservant and, most impor- tantly, what they regarded as religious boundary markers, which always have great symbolic importance, even though they need not be identical to the most serious halakhic violations. Although Ferziger's sociological approach is important to the book's argu- ment, those whose primary interest is historical will also benefit greatly. For example, Ferziger shows how the notion of separatist Orthodoxy, commonly attributed to Samson Raphael Hirsch and later a powerful force in Germany and Hungary, can actually be identified a century and a half earlier in the writings of Hakham Zvi Hirsch Ashkenazi of Amsterdam. Though the sentiments of Ashkenazi had no direct connection with the development of Hirschian-style separatist Orthodoxy, it is significant that the patterns of thought that later became so influential are already found in Ashkenazi, who lived in a "traditional" rather than an "Orthodox" world. It is thus proper to regard him as a forerunner of Hirsch's ideas, and not surprisingly, once Hirsch's separatist ideology was formu- lated, Ashkenazi's words were quoted to support it. Another strong point of the book is Ferziger's analysis of Hirsch's view of Austritt and the contrast with Bamberger's position, both of which are more com- plicated than they are often portrayed. In particular, Ferziger focuses on Hirsch's view of the individual nonobservant Jew. It has become almost a truism in Ortho- dox presentations of Hirsch's outlook that although he had a negative view of the Reform movement and its leaders, this negative outlook did not extend to individ- ual nonobservants, who were regarded as unwitting sinners, that is, people who were to be judged sympathetically because of their lack of education. It is not sur- prising that this is a standard view, as Hirsch himself claimed that he was against heresy, not heretics. In addition, contemporary Orthodoxy is very involved in "outreach," and basic to this outreach is the notion that nonobservant Jews cannot be judged negatively because they do not know any better. Yet Ferziger shows that the matter is much more complicated, and he skill- fully illustrates the tension in Hirsch's writings on this point. In fact, as far as I am aware, Ferziger is the first to really call attention to this point. For example, in Hirsch's response to Bamberger, he cites Maimonides to support the view that public Sabbath violators have removed themselves from the Jewish collective, and thus contrary to Bamberger, one must not remain in the same community with them. Hirsch also cites R. Moses Sofer's famous declaration that the 465</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Orthodox should completely separate from the nonobservant; Sofer was referring to the individual nonobservant, not Reform communal institutions. In Ferziger's words, "The reader is left with the sense that even if Hirsch found ways to nomin- ally keep modem nonobservant Jews within the Jewish framework, he did not completely stop seeing them as the embodiment of the evildoer as expressed in traditional halakhic texts" (122). In addition to his sensitivity to significant historical and sociological aspects in the responsa he analyzes, Ferziger shows that he is able to competently maneu- ver through the sometimes arcane halakhic argumentation, simplifying matters for the reader who lacks the training to approach these texts independently.' In sum, this is a significant work that scholars in a variety of fields will find very useful. Marc B. Shapiro University of Scranton Scranton, Pennsylvania</page></plain_text>
