On the Genealogy of Legal Status in Biblical Law and Literature by Robert S. Kawashima In other words, it is when the woman begins to emancipate herself, when she has the right to property as such, when she becomes an individual in society, that the significance of marriage begins to be abraded. At bottom, the woman is introduced into the symbolic part of marriage as the object of exchange between ... fundamentally androcentric lineages. To understand the various elementary structures is to understand how these objects of exchanges, the women, circulate between these lineages. (Jacques Lacan, Seminar II, 262-63) In Genesis 26, one of the so-called wife-sister stories, Abimelech King of Gerar catches Isaac "playing" with the woman he had introduced as his sister, namely, Rebekah his wife. He immediately confronts the trickster, rebuking him for presenting his wife as a single and therefore sexually available woman: "What is this you have done to us? One of the people could easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us" (Genesis 26:10). Abimelech's remarks ought to give one pause. He apparently suggests that sexual contact with this Hebrew woman is as easy as brushing elbows with a stranger in a crowded street, which is to say, he fails to consider or even acknowledge the possibility that Rebekah might have just said "No!" Furthermore, the narrowly avoided "guilt" he refers to consists not of this woman's rape by some local sexual predator - in which case her secret identity as Isaac's wife would be irrelevant - but of an other- wise innocent man's unwitting violation, consensual or nonconsensual, it matters I would like to thank Laura Quilter, Stephen Russell and the anonymous reader at the AJS Review , whose astute comments helped me to improve this article. I am also grateful to the organizers and participants of the Annual Conference of the AJS (2006) and of the International Meeting of the SBL (2006), where I read it in abbreviated form. I wrote the first version of this study in the spring of 2006, while a Dorot assistant professor and faculty fellow in New York University's Skirball Depart- ment of Hebrew and Judaic Studies, and it was there that I first presented the ideas developed more fully here; on that occasion, Mark Smith in particular provided generous encouragement and feedback. In appreciation of the three years I spent at Washington Square Park, I dedicate this article to that wonder- ful department and to my friends and colleagues there. l</page><page sequence="2">Robert S. Kawashima not, of her treacherously concealed marital obligations. In other words, the underlying legal reasoning here conceives of Rebekah not as an autonomous subject whose rights (i.e., the right to refuse a sexual advance).must be protected, but as an object within the domain of her husband, whose prior claims - namely, to sexual exclusiv- ity - must be respected. Abimelech's at-first puzzling remarks, then, provide us with a glimpse into a wholly foreign legal episteme or discursive formation. To interpret ancient laws correctly, as well as the narratives presupposing them, one must reconstruct this episteme, that is, the legal concepts and principles operating in biblical Israel. The failure to do so has led to the unwitting imposition of modern ideas and ideals onto biblical (and other ancient) texts. One particularly striking example of this problem is the concept of "legal status." Who is endowed with what rights, duties, and so forth? Can one speak, in particular, of "women's rights" - or "human rights" in general, for that matter - in biblical law and litera- ture? As various Priestly and Deuteronomic laws attest - apropos of inheritance and property (Numbers 27 and 36), vows (Numbers 30), sexual crimes (Deuteron- omy 22: 13-29), and others - women did not constitute autonomous entities before the law in biblical Israel, not to mention the ancient world at large (in fact, neither exactly did men, as we will see). As a result, women possessed, for lack of a better term, few if any "rights." As Tikva Frymer-Kensky recognized - while failing to draw out the ultimate consequences of her insight - they specifically lacked the power of "sexual consent," which resided in the father and then the husband.1 To follow this premise to its logical conclusion: If the modern concept of forcible rape is defined as a nonconsensual sexual encounter in which the "object" of the encounter is also its "victim" - the one whose rights have been violated - then there was no such thing as forcible rape in biblical Israel's legal system.2 Biblical law, inasmuch as one might posit a coherent view on this matter, does recognize the possibility of a forcible sexual encounter, but it defines it as a particular case of the more general crime of illicit sex, and identifies the "victim" of this crime as the father or husband whose claims over the "object" of the crime3 - daughter or wife - have been "violated" ( ' innah ).4 The underlying system becomes 1.

She fails, however, to suspend modern ideas concerning individual rights and other issues. 2.

Athalya Brenner (Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1994), 102-12. 3. A man's power over his wife and children arguably constituted a type of limited ownership. Indeed, Exodus 20:17 provides what is, in effect, a list of the patriarch's belongings - house, wife, slave, ox, etc. - though an Israelite male cannot be said to have "owned" his wife in the way that he owned an article of clothing, a beast of burden, etc.: see Leo G. Perdue, "The Israelite and Early Jewish Family: Summary and Conclusions," in Leo G. Perdue, Joseph Blenkinsopp, John J. Collins, and Carol Meyers, Families in Ancient Israel (Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 1997), 180-81. 4. Ci.

That is, she might refuse and even resist said advance, but since she was not a fully endowed legal entity, her refusal did not carry legally binding force - hence Rebekah's precarious position, as an apparently single woman, among the men of Gerar. Before proceeding, I must make three related caveats regarding the approach taken in this study First, the concept of legal status underlying biblical traditions is most clearly discerned within the broad perspective of a comparative analysis, and so I will not only discuss a variety of legal and literary texts from the Bible, but will also occasionally touch upon examples drawn from other ancient Near Eastern legal collections - although I will generally relegate the latter to the notes, in order to maintain the forward momentum of my central argument.5 That these diverse sources may disagree on various surface issues will only serve to emphasize their common base. For this reason, even Carolyn Pressler's important work on Deuteronomic "family law," which anticipates the present study at certain crucial points, fails to articulate clearly the overarching logic of biblical law, wrongly dismissing what she calls "composite pictures of the status of women in the Israelite family" on the grounds that they distort reality.6 Indeed, it is precisely the large "composite" view that enables one to discern the Sheffield Academic Press, 1998), 87; Wake , 192, 274 n. 34. If I am correct, this verb should never be translated as "rape," as it often is. Inasmuch as biblical legal thought recognized the basic personhood of all people, neither women nor girls could ever be reduced to pure objects. But neither did it recognize them as full subjects, and so they could never constitute victims of a legally prosecutable crime. Judges 19 provides an interesting test case. For inasmuch as the father-host seems to give his consent to the men of Gibeah to "violate" ( ve'annu ) his daughter and the Levite's concubine (Judges 19:24), they (and not he, whose consent was given) would seem to be the potential victims of the imagined crime. One must admit, however, that he makes this proposal under extreme duress, so that his speech seems less an act of consent than a forced concession for the sake of his male guest. The fact that he presumes to speak for the Levite further underscores his desperation and thus the infelicitous nature of his speech-act. Had his proposal been carried out, it seems plausible that he still could have claimed to be the victim of a crime inflicted upon his daughter. One might compare this scenario to Genesis 34. Jacob and his sons are, in effect, coerced into agreeing to Dinah's marriage to Shechem - a type of ex post facto arrangement perhaps, but fully legitimate and not without precedent (cf. Deuter- onomy 22:28-29). Simeon and Levi, however, still counting themselves victims (Genesis 34:31) of Shechem 's "violation" (vay'anneha) of their sister (Genesis 34:2), do not feel bound by their forced consent, and so they take the liberty of avenging themselves upon their newly acquired brother-in-law and his townsfolk. 5. For the latter texts, I use Martha T. Roth, Law Collections from Mesopotamia and Asia Minor , 2d ed. (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1997).

Kawashima logical relation between gender and legal status. Second, one must recognize that the norms officially prescribed by law do not necessarily correspond to the de facto practices of "everyday life." This is especially true of biblical law, which, as has frequently been noted, may have served a largely "symbolic" or "utopian" func- tion.7 Similarly, while the verisimilitude of biblical narrative justifies drawing certain inferences about ancient Israelite legal conventions from its more or less fictionalized episodes, one cannot simply take them at face value as the undis- torted reflection of historical "reality." It is for this reason that I generally refer in this study to biblical, not ancient, Israel. Far from reflecting any skepticism on my part regarding the latter 's historical existence, I merely acknowledge as an open question the extent to which the practices described and/or implied in bib- lical law and literature correspond to a lived "reality." Finally, as a philosophical realist, I crucially maintain the existence, external to any discourse (e.g., biblical law and literature), of "the real" - in the Lacanian sense - contrary to that famous poststructuralist slogan, il n'y a pas de hors-texte.s Thus, even though the laws and narratives examined here imagine and represent various acts of threatened and/or realized sexual violence against women (and occasionally men) through a particu- lar lens - "patriarchal," as we all know - there arguably exists, independent of this discursive representation, "the real" of such violence and, in particular, of the experience of those who are subjected to it.9 One might, then, posit forcible rape as "a real" within the external world of human interactions, even if, as I shall argue, biblical law and literature failed to perceive it.10 The failure to dis- tinguish between "the imaginary" (discursive representation) and "the real" con- tributes to Hillary B. Lipka's mistaken insistence on the presence of the concept 7. Thus, David Daube distinguishes between biblical law as such and "the Hebrew state" ( Studies in Biblical Law [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1947], 1-2). Biblical law is partly "utopian": see, e.g., Menahem Haran, Temples and Temple-Service in Ancient Israel (Oxford: Clarendon, 1978), 122-31; Binyamin Uffenheimer, "Utopia and Reality in Biblical Thought," Imma- nuel 9 (1979): 5-15. Relatedly, it sometimes functions "in terrorem," viz., as a mere rhetorical deterrent: see, e.g., G. R. Driver and J. C. Miles, The Babylonian Laws (Oxford: Clarendon, 1960), 1:400; J. J. Finkelstein, "Sex Offenses in Sumerian Laws," Journal of the American Oriental Society 86 (1966): 357. 8. In other words, Lacan was a realist: see Jean-Claude Milner, "Lacan and the Ideal of Science," in Lacan and the Human Sciences , ed. Alexandre Leupin (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1991), 27-42. For a succinct exposition of Lacan's three registers (real, imaginary, and sym- bolic), see Milner, Les noms indistincts (Paris: Editions du Seuil, 1983), 7-17. 9. Conversely, if Carol Meyers has leveled some interesting criticisms against the common belief that ancient Israel was "patriarchal," she seems to have in mind the "real" Israel external to the text: "Contesting the Notion of Patriarchy: Anthropology and the Theorizing of Gender in Ancient Israel," in A Question of Sex?, ed. Deborah W. Rooke (Sheffield, UK: Sheffield Phoenix Press, 2007), 84-105. It seems undeniable, however, that the biblical representations of Israel take for granted a patriarchal framework - even if, as Meyers argues, the definition of "patriarchy" must be attenuated and adjusted in various ways. 10. One might point to Yael Shemesh's recent study in this regard, though she obscures the con- ceptual distance between modern and ancient cultures: "Rape Is Rape Is Rape: The Story of Dinah and Shechem (Genesis 34)," Zeitschrift fur die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft 119 (2007): 2-21. 4</page><page sequence="5">Could a Woman Say "No" in Biblical Israel? of rape in both the Bible and ancient Israel.11 Moreover, one could imagine pro- jects other than what I will attempt here - for example, recovering the "voice" of the crime's "object," lodged like a foreign body within biblical tradition. Such an analysis would be akin to liana Pardes's study of what she calls biblical "counter-traditions."12 In the meantime, however, I have the more modest aim of reconstructing a small number of crucial legal concepts and principles as described in certain laws and presupposed in various narratives, especially as they pertain to the legal status of women in the Bible. On the Genealogy of Legal Status What is needed is a "genealogy" of the legal entity and legal status, which, it must be emphasized, are not immediately and definitively given to human thought.13 If, as Marcel Mauss famously observed, the very "notion of person" or "self' is not a natural fact but a "concept" that has "slowly been elaborated," it follows that this same notion, specifically as a subject of law, must similarly have a history.14 For the purposes of framing this study, then, let us merely pose the basic question for ourselves: What is the modern legal subject and how does it differ from the entity found in biblical tradition? Modern liberalism, broadly defined, begins with an idealization. Let us call it the "liberal subject," that is, the autonomous individual, stripped, at least in theory, of the distinguishing qualities of individuality and reduced thereby to a bare and abstract unit of equality - an instance of what Deleuze called le quelcon- que (the anything whatsoever).15 Variously endowed with the will, power, and right to act in its self-interest, the liberal subject constitutes the primitive concept on the basis of which are constructed the various contracts, social and 1 1 .

I specifically invoke Foucault's approach to "genealogy": see, e.g., Foucault, "Nietzsche, Genealogy, History," in Aesthetics, Method, and Epistemology , ed. James D. Faubion (New York: The New Press, 1998), 369-91. Harold C. Washington similarly conceives of his analysis of gender in biblical law as a "Foucauldian genealogy," but he views this "procedure" primarily as a means of "expos[ing]" the "exercise of power in normative discourse": '"Lest He Die in the Battle and Another Man Take Her': Violence and the Construction of Gender in the Laws of Deuteronomy 20- 22," in Gender and Law, 191.

One might arguably posit an historical relationship between the liberal subject and the Lacanian "subject of science": see Jean-Claude Milner, L'Oeuvre claire: Lacan, la science, la philosophic (Paris: Seuil, 1995), 33-76; English translation: "The Doctrine of Science," in Slavoj Zizek, ed., Jacques Lacan: Critical Evaluations in Cultural Theory (London: Routledge, 2003), 1:264-94. 5</page><page sequence="6">Robert S. Kawashima legal, of modern political thought, from the Hobbesian man, whose "natural right" would lead the human species into that famous state of war, "of every man, against every man," to the Rousseauan man, "born free" and yet "everywhere in chains." It was articulated most explicitly in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations in 1948, and it currently animates what Alain Badiou disparagingly calls "the ethic of human rights."16 In biblical Israel, however, it was not the individual but the patriarchal household or extended family - namely, the "house of the father/husband" ( beit 'av / 'ish)' cf. Akkadian bit abi - that was thought to constitute a legal entity.17 An individual's legal status, then, far from deriving from an abstract universal notion of personhood, was rather a function of one's concrete particular position or role within the household.18 For this reason, the biblical category of the poor and the helpless - those who must be defended from injustice - specifically con- sists of widows, orphans, and aliens (Exodus 22:20-21; Deuteronomy 10:18, 14:29; Jeremiah 7:6; Ezekiel 22:7; etc.), that is, those not belonging to a legitimate household and thus without status, without recourse to normal protections, legal, social, material, and so on. Similarly, divorce, according to the biblical Hebrew idiom, consisted of "sending" ( sh-l-h ) the wife away from the husband's house (Deuteronomy 24:1). 19 Conversely, "confirmed bachelors" and "spinsters" have left few if any traces in the Bible, since they effectively constituted structural impossibilities, it being well nigh unthinkable that a boy or girl should not marry at the proper age and thus assume his or her rightful place within a house.20 Not even the patriarch should be thought of as an autonomous individual. He may have represented the household as its head, but his legal status was still a 16. Alain Badiou, Ethics: An Essay on the Understanding of Evil (New York: Verso, 2001), 4-17. 17. Material culture appears to reflect the concept of the patriarchal household: see Lawrence Stager, "The Archaeology of the Family in Ancient Israel," Bulletin of the American Schools of Orien- tal Research 260 (1985): 1-35; and J. David Schloen, The House of the Father as Fact and Symbol (Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2001). That material culture does so prior to or beneath literary culture attests to the common legal ground of the various sources addressed in this study. 18. See Carol Meyers, "The Family in Early Israel," in Families in Ancient Israel, 21-22. The subordination of the individual to the family is related to the idea of "communal responsibility": see, e.g., Daube, Biblical Law , 154-89.

See also Roland de Vaux, Ancient Israel: Its Life and Institutions (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1965), 1: 19-61; Johannes Pedersen, Israel: Its Life and Culture (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1991), 1:46-81. 19. By the same logic, when God "sends" ( vayshalhehu ) Adam and Eve away from Eden (Genesis 3.23), they cease being dependents of the divine household, which is also related to the sig- nificance of "knowing good and evil" (more on which see below). 20. A woman could be rendered unfit for marriage. Tamar, after being violated by her half- brother Amnon (an episode which we will return to later), is described as living in a "state of desola- tion" (. shomemah ) in the "house of Absalom" her brother (2 Samuel 13:20). Similarly, David, after quel- ling Absalom's coup, places his concubines, who have been sexually possessed by his rebel son, under a type of house arrest (beit mishmeret), where they live out their days in "perpetual widowhood [ 'almenut hayyutY (2 Samuel 20:3). Note, in both cases they remain attached to a specific house. Men, it should be added, were not susceptible to the same sort of compromise. 6</page><page sequence="7">Could a Woman Say "No" in Biblical Israel? function of his position relative to this corporate legal entity. In fact, thanks to the principle of patrilineal succession, the household itself constituted but a moment in the larger life of the "lineage" (toledot), whence the importance of the family estate or patrimony - "inheritance, possession" (yerushah , nahalah) or "holding" (' ahuzzah )21 - the continuous possession of which linked generation to gener- ation. What we would now call "private property" was not fully at the patriarch's disposal, since his house was beholden both to its past and future: Witness the restrictions placed upon the selling of family property in Leviticus 25. 22 Ulti- mately, the very nation of Israel was an extension of these tribal realities. The census in Numbers 1-3, for example, neatly spells out the Priestly system for defining and relating these entities: tribe ( matteh ), clans (mishpehot), patriarchal households (beit ' avot ), and names of adult males ( shemot ).23 Any household claiming membership in the "congregation" ( 'edah) of Israel needed in principle to trace its lineage back to this genealogical structure. As a result, the Bible betrays little if any awareness of human rights as such, and these must be extricated from biblical interpretation with the same care and rigor with which Foucault, for example, banished the notion of repression from the history of sexuality.24 Biblical law concerns itself rather with the mutual obli- gations, duties, and claims25 - mishpat, zedakah, mizwah , etc.26 - that character- ize kinship and by extension society: Honoring one's parents, respecting the property of one's neighbor, and so forth. Consider, for example, the various prac- tices and institutions gathered under the umbrella concept of "redemption" (g'l ). Redeeming the blood of a slain kinsman does not uphold his right to justice, but restores the honor and integrity of the family bloodline through vengeance. The related institution of the cities of refuge (Exodus 21:12-14; Numbers 35:9-34; Deuteronomy 19:1-13; Joshua 20) does not guarantee the right of the 21.

One might argue that Naboth, e.g., had the "right" or at least de facto ability to sell off the "inheritance of [his] fathers" ( nahalat 'avot ay), but his vehement rejection of King Ahab's proposition suggests that such an act would constitute a betrayal of his family line and of Yahweh himself (1 Kings 21:3). 23.

For example: the firstborn son has a just claim {mishpat) to a double portion of the inheri- tance, regardless of the father's personal wishes (Deuteronomy 21:17); Tamar's deception of Judah put her in the "right" ( zadekah ), inasmuch as he had failed to give her his youngest son Shelah in marriage (Genesis 38:26); and God expects Abraham to "charge [yezawweh] his sons and his house [beito] after him to observe the way of Yahweh by doing righteousness [zedakah] and justice [ mishpat ]" (Genesis 1 8: 19). In each case, these concepts derive their meaning not from an absolute right intrinsic to the indi- vidual, but from a relational duty, i.e., an obligation owed by one party to another. 7</page><page sequence="8">Robert S. Kawashima accused to a fair trial, but guards society itself from the pollution of bloodshed by requiring it to determine whether he is a murderer who must be handed over to his victim's redeemer, or a perpetrator of manslaughter who must be granted sanctuary instead. Finally, redeeming one's enslaved kin and/or the latter 's mortgaged land (Leviticus 25) does not maintain his right to freedom and to property, but restores the integrity or purity of the clan's relationship to the land of Israel, by returning its members to their rightful place.27 The covenant, in turn, generalizes such claims made by the kin group upon its members, by extending the metaphor and logic of kinship to broader relationships within and between societies. A "social con- tract" drawn up between parties without natural blood ties, it creates the obli- gations of kinship - "loving kindness" (hesed)- between adoptive relatives.28 The Legal Status of Women The distinctive logic underlying the patriarchal household is brought into clearest relief in the legal status of its female members, which one can usefully approach through the idea of legal competence.29 By modern convention, on the one hand, legal competence - including the power of sexual consent - is gen- erally granted to each individual adult, male or female, who by virtue of age and mental capacity has attained majority. Majors have, in effect, the authority to say "yes" or "no." Conversely, minors cannot enter into legally binding contracts or engage in activities whose ramifications are deemed sufficiently grave. What is more, they can be shielded from exploitation through various special protections that effectively say "no" on their behalf - for example, laws dealing with child labor and statutory rape - which in some cases can even override the consent of legal guardians. If in biblical Israel, on the other hand, not even the patriarch could be said to possess "rights" as such, the father nonetheless spoke for the household from its symbolic center. That biblical narrative provides counterexam- ples of weak and ineffectual fathers does not call into question the general rule. Each son, in turn, could expect to assume that same position within his own house- hold upon the father's death and the subsequent division of the estate among the male heirs. Such was not the case, however, for daughters: A girl lived under the legal guardianship or "house" of her father (beit ' av ), until she was betrothed and eventually married, at which point she entered the guardianship or "house" of her husband (beit ' ish ). In other words, a woman could never attain to the same legal status as her male counterpart, unless she were widowed or divorced - that is, detached from the houses of both father and husband. That biblical Israel possessed some notion of legal majority is clear from Numbers 14. Here the Israelites, having tried God's patience one time too many, are condemned to die in the wilderness, illustrating the principle of 27. For further details, see Robert S.

"bearing one's guilt," that is, dying for one's sins: "You will bear your guilt [tis 'u 'avonotekhem' for forty years" (Numbers 14:34), God declares.30 Not all of the Israelites, however, will suffer this fate, only those who have reached their twen- tieth year (Numbers 14:29) - the same age at which men were counted in the census (Numbers 1 :2-3). At least according to the Priestly source, then, an Israe- lite reached adulthood at the age of twenty. The Deuteronomic account of this same event corroborates the general principle. According to Moses, it is the Israe- lites' "little ones," who "do not know good and evil" (lo ' yad'u ... tov vara % that will enter the land and possess it (Deuteronomy 1:39). The "knowledge of good and evil" signifies not a fall from grace but an ascent to adulthood as a moral agent who is henceforth accountable for his or her actions. Thus, in the Garden of Eden, it is only when Adam and Eve assert their independence vi's-a-vis God-as-father, seizing this knowledge for themselves, even at the ostensible risk of death itself, that they outgrow their lowly station of "living being" ( nefesh hayyah ), an ontological status shared with the animals (Genesis 2:7, 19), and become - indeed, make themselves into- fully human beings that are now "like God" (i ke'lohim ) (Genesis 3:5, 22).31 Leviticus 27:2-7 further clarifies the Priestly view of age and status, by setting out the valuation of humans as the object of vows: Infant, from one month to five years; child, from five to twenty; adult, from twenty to sixty; and elderly, from one's sixtieth year on.32 At adulthood, then, both men and women acquired a minimal level of legal competence. This competence, however, amounted to nothing more than a basic moral agency: It merely maintained that all adult human beings should be held accountable for their actions; specifically, it made it possible for an individual to be considered guilty of a crime. In order to be treated as the victim of a crime, one had to be endowed with a legal status above and beyond basic compe- tence: One had to possess, for lack of a better word, certain "rights." But an indi- vidual's legal status, as I have already observed, was merely a function of his or her gendered position within the house, with the result that only the household's males in general and the patriarch in particular effectively attained full legal status - only they, technically speaking, could be victims. For this reason, legal cases involving more than the operation of basic moral agency differentiate between male and female entities. The Priestly law in Numbers 30 dealing with the fulfillment of oaths cru- cially distinguishes between men and women as moral actors. If men must 30. Frymer-Kensky refers to this as a "danger belief," the idea that certain unverifiable infrac- tions will nonetheless be subject to divine sanction: see "Pollution, Purification, and Purgation in Bib- lical Israel," in The Word of the Lord Shall Go Forth: Essays in Honor of David Noel Freedman in Celebration of His Sixtieth Birthday , ed. Carol L. Meyers and M. O'Connor (Winona Lake, IN: Eisen- brauns, 1983), 404-406. 3 1 .

Leviticus 27 seems to apply to the civilian population, probably in relation to the material functioning of the household. Numbers 4 and 8:23-26, apropos of the Levites, seems to define pro- fessional adulthood, respectively, as thirty or twenty-five to fifty years old. 9</page><page sequence="10">Robert S. Kawashima simply fulfill their oaths and vows without exception (Numbers 30:3), vows made by women are subject to some telling special provisions. Thus, as long as a girl lives in "her father's house," the father has the power to nullify her vows, at least within a certain brief window of opportunity (Numbers 30:4-6). If he exer- cises his power of preemption, she shall disregard her vow with impunity. Note that the father's claims in this matter apparently do not extend over the sons living under his roof, who even as boys are treated as "men" with respect to their vows. The husband possesses an even greater authority with respect to his wife's vows. Not only can he nullify the vows his wife makes while living in his "house" (Numbers 30:11-16), but he can also cancel the vows she previously made while living with her father (Numbers 30:7-9). These lingering obligations from "her youth" (Numbers 30:4) are called "utterances of her lips [sefateihaY (Numbers 30:7, 9) or "proceedings of her lips [sefateihaY (Numbers 30:13), apparently in order to capture their relatively superficial or less binding nature, as opposed to "all that proceeds from [a man's] mouth [mippivY (Numbers 30:3). The law, in other words, enables the husband to receive a bride who is free of legal liabilities, a "clean slate," as it were - not unlike the ideal of virginity itself. Furthermore, the law grants the husband an extended veto power, beyond that of the father: He can override her vows even sometime after he hears of them, but in this extreme case, he will "bear her guilt" (Numbers 30:15-16). Apparently, the law recognizes that a wife's obligations to her husband's house are greater than those of a daughter to her father's house. Widows and divorcees, bound to neither husband nor father, constitute the crucial exception: Their vows must stand, not unlike those of a man (Numbers 30: 10).33 The structure of the passage reveals the symbolic space underlying this law: Vows made by a girl in her father's house (Numbers 30:4-9) The father's veto power over these vows (Numbers 30:4-6) The husband's veto power over these vows (Numbers 30:7-9) Vows made by a widow or divorcee between houses (Numbers 30:10) Vows made by a woman in her husband's house (Numbers 30:11-16) The exceptional case in verse 10 interrupts what might otherwise have been inter- preted as a chronological sequence, by assuming its liminal position between houses. The crucial boundary between girlhood and womanhood - namely, the transfer from one house to another - is visible in other laws as well. Leviticus 21:1-4 forbids a priest, a son of Aaron, from defiling himself through exposure to corpse impurity, except for the sake of his immediate family members - mother, father, son, daughter, brother - but apparently not as a husband for his wife and in-laws (Leviticus 21:4), who are not "his close [karov] flesh-relations" 33. The prostitute occupies the same structural position as the widow and divorcee, viz., that no-man's land between legitimate (patriarchal) households. For this reason, she alone among women exercises sexual consent - cf. Frymer-Kensky, Wake, 19 A - just as widows and divorcees must fulfill their vows. 10</page><page sequence="11">Could a Woman Say "No" in Biblical Israel? (Leviticus 21 :2). Crucially, he can mourn for his sister only if she is still a virgin, "close [kerovah] to him because she has not been married" (Leviticus 21 :3).34 Consummation of marriage ushers her into a new house and a new set of relations and obligations.35 Similarly, Leviticus 22:10-13 stipulates that only those belong- ing to a priestly household - purchased slaves and those "born in his house" (Levi- ticus 22:11) - may eat of the priest's "sacred contributions." Note the loose analogy between property (slaves) and familial dependents. Again, a priest's daughter is reckoned as part of his family only as long as she remains unmarried. If she marries a "strange man" ( 'ish zar ) - that is, a nonpriest (Leviticus 22:12) - thus becoming part of a profane rather than sacred household, she may no longer partake of priestly fare. But should she, being childless, become divorced or widowed and return "to her father's house, as in her youth" (Leviticus 22:13), she may once again partake of her father's sacred food. The patriarchal system governing women's oaths similarly limits the cir- cumstances under which a woman might own property.36 In Numbers 27, the daughters of Zelophehad approach Moses and Eleazar in order to voice their con- cerns regarding their father's heritage, who died without leaving behind any sons to carry on his name. He was not a member of Korah's rebellious congregation, who disqualified themselves from receiving a patrimony in the land (Numbers 27:3), an extreme punishment that the redaction of Numbers 16 likens to the fate of Dathan and Abiram, upon whom God, for all intents and purposes, imposed karet , namely, having one's lineage altogether "cut off' from the people: "And they vanished from the midst of the assembly" (Numbers 16:33).37 Rather, as an adult member of the so-called wilderness generation, he was sentenced to the lesser penalty of "bearing one's guilt" (Numbers 14:34). As his daughters thus correctly argue, since he has already "died for his own sin" (Numbers 27:3), it would be unjust to impose, in effect, the harsher punish- ment of karet , simply because he had the misfortune of fathering only daughters: "Why should the name of our father be removed [yiggara *] from the midst of his clan [&lt; mishpahto ], because he had no son. Give us a holding [ ' ahuzzah ] amidst the brothers of our father" (Numbers 27:4). Moses consults with God, who agrees, 34. Scholars have come to favor "young girl" as the meaning of betulah. At least in the texts examined here, however, virginity (betulim) is assumed to correspond to age and marital status. See Frymer-Kensky, "Virginity." 35. By the same logic, a priest cannot marry a woman who is tainted by prostitution or divorce (Leviticus 21:7); the additional condition of virginity (nondivorced) holds upon the high priest (Levi- ticus 21:14). Marriage and, in particular, consummation change the status of a woman. 36. For detailed discussion, see Zafrira Ben-Barak, Inheritance by Daughters in Israel and the Ancient Near East (Tel Aviv: Archaeological Center, 2006). 37. In fact, the combination of JE and P in 16:32 has Korah and company swallowed up along with Dathan and Abiram; meanwhile, 17:5 (16:40) suggests instead that Korah was consumed by divine fire before the tent of meeting; in either case, the gloss in 26:1 1 insists that his line was not subject to karet. See Jacob Milgrom, Numbers (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1990), 221-22, 230-33, 414-23; Baruch Levine, Numbers 21-36: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary by Baruch Levine , Anchor Yale Bible Commentaries (New York: Doubleday, 2000), 4A:317-18, 344- 48; and Israel Knohl, Sanctuary of Silence (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1995), 73-85. 11</page><page sequence="12">Robert S. Kawashima leading to a special provision within standard inheritance procedure: in the absence of sons, a man's daughters will inherit; in the absence of daughters, his brothers; and in the absence of brothers, uncles. The ruling thus spells out a des- cending scale of kinship relations: son, daughter, brother, uncle. While it is note- worthy that women could own property in biblical Israel, they could do so only in the absence of an appropriate male household (beit Hsh). The fatherless, brother- less woman, then, found herself in a liminal position analogous to that of the widow and the divorcee. If it makes her more "modern" in our eyes, it does not make her situation more desirable. The saga of Zelophehad's house continues in Numbers 36, when concerns surrounding his daughters' heirs arise. This time it is the tribal elders who approach Moses: "Now, if they marry one of the men from another Israelite tribe [shivtei benei yisra'el], their inheritance [nahalatan] will be removed [wenigre 'ah] from the inheritance [minnahalat] of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe [nahalat hammatteh ] into which they marry" (Numbers 36:3). Their peti- tion reflects the Priestly conception of Israel as being constituted through a divine land grant that projected its kinship structure onto the two-dimensional surface of the promised land. Within this spatialized kinship system, geographical proximity corresponded to familial proximity. As I have argued elsewhere, the Priests viewed the original distribution of tribal lands as the "pure" state of the nation.38 Allowing these property-owning daughters to marry into another tribe would there- fore introduce chaos or entropy - a type of "geopolitical" impurity - into the nation's sacred spatial order. As a result, Moses, at God's behest, makes an adden- dum to his earlier ruling: The daughters of Zelophehad must many "into a clan [lemishpahat] of their father's tribe ... so that no inheritance of the Israelites may be transferred from tribe to tribe" (Numbers 36:6-7). Ultimately, a woman was only permitted to own property under certain circumstances and then merely as a concession to patriarchal necessity. For this ad hoc provision existed primarily to serve the interests of the father's "name" (Numbers 27:4) by preserving the continu- ity and integrity of patrilineal succession, concretized in the family estate - its "holding" (Numbers 27:4) or "inheritance" (Numbers 36:3). Sexual Consent The nature and extent of the patriarch's authority over his family is most fully revealed in his power of sexual consent over his daughters. Consider first of all the arranged marriage, which already entails the subordination of the inter- ests of the individuals involved - bride, groom et al. - to the extent that they are even conceived of as autonomous subjects, to larger familial considerations. A family might choose to consult a daughter about her wishes - as does Rebekah's family regarding her betrothal to Isaac (Genesis 24:39, 5 1 , 57-58), who, one might add, has less to say in the matter than she - but nothing, it would seem, requires them to do so. Thus, the Priestly injunction in Leviticus 19:29 against a father "profaning" his daughter by "prostituting her" ( lehaznotah ) indicates both the 38. See Kawashima, "Jubilee Year." 12</page><page sequence="13">Could a Woman Say "No" in Biblical Israel? father's de facto authority over the daughter (in choosing a suitable mate for her) and its possible perversion by those who would profit from it. In fact, the Covenant Code expressly allows a man to sell his daughter into a form of slavery that included making the girl sexually available to either the purchaser or his son (Exodus 21:7-11). That she would be given to only one man and would enjoy the privileges of a wife seems to differentiate this conjugal transaction from pros- titution, making it merely a financially desperate form of arranged marriage instead. The point remains, however, that her "consent" can count for but little under such circumstances. Finally, in the most extreme version of an "arranged" marriage, women and girls were sometimes taken as part of the spoils of war.39 The Deuteronomic law addressing this practice (Deuteronomy 21:10-14) neither condemns it as a version of rape nor punishes it as a crime at all.40 Rather, it merely insists that the captive bride be treated as a wife, not a slave. It thereby seeks to compensate for the fact that her husband has, in effect, "violated her ['innitah'" (Deuteronomy 21:14) by failing to procure her father's approval, which in the present instance was precluded by the state of war. This genealogical reconstruction helps clarify some rather infamous narra- tives. For example, contemporary readers often condemn Lot for offering up his daughters to the men of Sodom in Genesis 19 - similarly, the Levite and his unnamed host in Judges 19 - but this is a reaction born of modern sensibilities. Given the extreme circumstances, he arguably exercised his legitimate paternal power of consent over virgin daughters.41 The story as a whole, after all, presents Lot as a righteous man, setting up two pointed parallels between him and his venerable uncle. First, just as Abraham shows his worth in graciously receiving the heavenly visitors into his tent (Genesis 18:1-8), so Lot, knowing the perils the two strangers will face in the city square, "presses" (Genesis 19:3) the reluctant guests to spend the night in his home instead, where he persists in protecting them, even when this means putting himself and his family in harm's way.42 Second, just 39. Shemesh discusses the phenomenon of "abduction marriage" in relation to Genesis 34 in "Rape"; her study is in large part a critical response to Joseph Fleishman, "Shechem and Dinah, in the Light of Non- Biblical and Biblical Sources," Zeitschrift Jur die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft 116 (2004): 12-32. 40. See Pressler, Family Laws , 9-15; Washington, "Lest he die in the battle," 202-207. 41. See Frymer-Kensky, Wake , 193; Women , 123-26. It is crucial to the story's logic that Lot's daughters were virgins. Similarly in Judges 19, the Levite's companion is not a full-fledged wife but a mere concubine (pilegesh ), while his host's daughter is, again, a virgin. As will become clear in the discussion of Deuteronomy 22, virgin daughters are still under the authority of their fathers; the Levite's concubine was apparently sexually available in a way a wife would not be. True, Lot's daugh- ters may have been engaged (Genesis 19:14), but the narrative need not conform to Deuteronomic law in all details. It is also possible that Lot had more than two daughters. One can plausibly read the adjec- tive "found" in 19:15 as a restrictive clause - "your two daughters who are found here [hannim- za'ot ]" - in which case, his sons-in-law (Genesis 19:14) were wed to other daughters not found in his house and thus no longer under his authority to take away with him. 42. Hospitality, one should add, was a cardinal virtue in this and other ancient cultures, and it is the central theme of Genesis 18-19: see Robert Alter, "Sodom as Nexus: The Web of Design in Biblical Narrative," in The Book and the Text , ed. Regina Schwartz (Cambridge: Blackwell, 1990), 146-60. 13</page><page sequence="14">Robert S. Kawashima as Abraham bargains with God in an attempt to spare the wicked many on account of the righteous few (Genesis 18:23-32), so Lot bargains with God's angels to save Zoar from the general destruction (Genesis 19:18-23). Indeed, where Abra- ham's negotiated terms ultimately fail - through no fault of his own, there being not even ten righteous souls in all the cities of the plain - Lot's succeed. For if he and his family are too few in number to earn the general amnesty Abraham had aimed for, their presence nevertheless suffices to ransom a "small" (Genesis 19:20) town from fire and brimstone. Furthermore, one should recall that Abra- ham's negotiations do not appeal to the idea of unconditional mercy, but invoke the principle of "justice," specifically, not slaying "the righteous with the wicked" (Genesis 18:25): The fact, then, that Lot is spared, that God refuses to rain down divine wrath until his escape is secured (Genesis 19:22), suggests that he earned his salvation and his family's through his righteous behavior, specifically his hospitality, epitomized by his willingness to sacrifice his daugh- ters' sexual integrity for the sake of his male guests.43 In light of this divine approval, it is unlikely that Lot's drunken incestuous encounters with his daugh- ters should be interpreted as divine retribution - which is not to deny that this episode casts aspersions on Israel's rivals to the east. Rather, his daughters' brazen quest, as Frymer-Kensky rightly observes, "fits well into the biblical con- ception of women's actions," namely, the "desire for motherhood."44 One should compare their desperate attempt to "keep alive seed" ( unehayyeh ... zara from their father (Genesis 19:34) to Noah's divine charge "to keep seed alive" ( lehayyot zera *) in the face of the flood (Genesis 7:3), part of the allusion in Genesis 19 to J's flood story. One also recalls the aftermath of Judges 19, when the decimated tribe of Benjamin is threatened with extinction - a type of man-made karet. The other tribes, having sworn never to give their own daughters in marriage to this anath- ematized tribe, must now rescue their brothers' lineage by procuring them suitable wives, without violating their oath. First, they devote Jabesh-Gilead to "destruc- tion" (i herem ) for having failed to come to their aid against Benjamin in the first place (Judges 21:8-14): that is, they kill every male and every nonvirgin woman, but spare the virgin girls and give them to the Benjaminites as wives. Second, they kidnap virgins from Shiloh as they come out of the city, apparently unescorted, dancing in celebration of an annual religious festival (Judges 21:1 9- 23). In neither case can these girls be said to consent to their abduction, and yet they are absorbed into what are represented as legitimate marriages. In the first instance, their fathers have been lawfully executed, and so their abduction consti- tutes no crime. The would-be "victims" have forfeited their rights, leaving their virgin daughters as the fair spoils of holy war. In the second, the Israelites show no interest in winning over the abducted girls themselves. Rather, they attempt 43. Note that the comment that Lot was spared because "God remembered Abraham" (Genesis 1 9:29) may credit the uncle with the nephew's survival, but this is a later Priestly, possibly editorial (R), gloss, reacting precisely to J's unacceptably positive portrayal of Lot. 44. See Frymer-Kensky, Wake , 125. 14</page><page sequence="15">Could a Woman Say "No" in Biblical Israel? to placate the actual "victims" of their crime, namely, the fathers and brothers who could justifiably retaliate. They therefore ask these men to "be gracious" (i hannunu ) in regard to their daughters' abduction, on the grounds that by fore- going their normal power of consent, they will provide wives to the Benjaminites without violating their oath, and they will thereby save a tribe of Israel (Judges 21:22). Sexual Crimes Deuteronomy 22:22-29 constitutes the principal textual witness regarding legal views on "sex crimes" in biblical Israel.45 These are presented in terms of four primary cases. A) Deuteronomy 22:22: +married, -virgin; "he is found"; implied complicity; kill both B) Deuteronomy 22:23-24: + engaged, + virgin; "he finds her in the town"; + complicity; kill both B') Deuteronomy 22:25-27: + engaged, + virgin; "he finds [her] in the field"; - complicity; kill him A') Deuteronomy 22:28-29: - engaged, + virgin; "they are found"; ? complicity; 50 shekels of silver to father Adele Berlin has recently suggested that these cases appear in descending order of severity of the punishment - from the death of both the man and woman (A and B) to the death of the man alone (B') to a mere fine (A').46 It is unclear, however, on what grounds one should distinguish between the severity of A and B. The true organizing principle of the passage is the chiastic arrange- ment of the various combinations of two features: +/- virgin and +/- married.47 The verb "find" (mzr) occurs in each case: niphal in A/A', qal in B/B'. A and A' deal with the opposite combination of features; B and B' involve the same com- bination of features in two different crime scenes, town and field. As Pressler 45. Alexander Rofe analyzes the compositional history of the "Family and Sex Laws in Deu- teronomy and the Book of the Covenant," in Deuteronomy: Issues and Interpretations (Edinburgh: T&amp;T Clark, 2002), 169-92. His findings (if one accepts them) do not affect my arguments, however, inasmuch as I address here certain widely shared concepts such as legal status. See also Cynthia Edenburg's arguments for the coherence of Deuteronomy 22:13-29 in "Ideology and Social Context of the Deuteronomic Women's Sex Laws (Deuteronomy 22:13-29)," Journal of Biblical Lit- erature 128 (2009): 43-60, esp. 43^8. For a comprehensive comparative analysis of "sex crimes" in the ancient Near East, see Lafont, Femmes, Droit et Justice , 29-288. 46. Adele Berlin, "Sex and the Single Girl in Deuteronomy 22," in Mishneh Todah: Studies in Deuteronomy and Its Cultural Environment in Honor of Jeffrey H. Tigay, ed. Nili Sacher Fox, David A. Glatt-Gilad, and Michael J. Williams (Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2009), 103; see also Jeffrey H. Tigay, Deuteronomy (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1996), 204. It is more accurate to say, following Edenburg, that Deuteronomy 22:13-29 comprises four paragraphs arranged in "descending order" of the female's "marital status" ("Women's Sex Laws," 44-45): married woman after consum- mation (13-21; 22); betrothed virgin (23-27); unbetrothed virgin (28-29) - which is compatible with the chiastic structure and underlying logic of the passage as I describe it. 47. The law does not differentiate between consummated and unconsummated marriage (engagement); thus, the young engaged virgin is already referred to as "wife" (Deuteronomy 22:24). 15</page><page sequence="16">Robert S. Kawashima observes, these laws do not deal with "rape" in the modern sense: "the offense is seen first of all as a violation of the claims of the man who controls the woman's sexuality."48 In A, B, and B', the perpetrator is said to have "violated [ ' innah ] his neighbor's wife" (Deuteronomy 22:24); the victim, then, is the husband (or fiance) of the crime's object (wife). The man's punishment is therefore identical in all three cases: death. In A', the object of the crime is an unengaged girl, and so the victim is her father, who receives payment for the "damages" done. On the surface, B and B' seem to acknowledge the girl's power of consent. Frymer-Kensky goes so far as to infer from the comparison in B' of a forcible sexual encounter with an assault-murder (Deuteronomy 22:26) that this law recog- nizes and treats "rape" as a violent crime.49 The comparison, however, points rather to one's vulnerability to assault in the open country, where no "deliverer" (; moshia'; Deuteronomy 22:27) is likely to be at hand. Thus, if the encounter took place in town, she must have been willing; if in the field, she was not.50 Fur- thermore, the girl's ostensible "consent" does not add to her attacker's guilt - does not enter, in other words, into the definition of the crime itself, which is identical in each case.51 More accurately, then, the location of the crime (town or field) deter- mines her "complicity": Whether or not she, too, is guilty and worthy of death, alongside her unauthorized sexual partner. The distinction between basic moral agency and full legal status (mentioned earlier) thus comes into play again: The girl can be guilty of a crime, but not, technically speaking, a victim of a crime, for which reason her noncomplicity does not add to the perpetrator's guilt.52 48. Pressler, View of Women , 37 n. 46; see also Washington, '"Lest he die in the battle'," 208-12. 49. Frymer-Kensky, Wake , 192. 50. The topos of the field might also imply premeditation: see, e.g., Genesis 4:8. Similar dis- tinctions are also to be found in other legal collections: see Eckart Otto, "Town and Countryside in Ancient Israelite Law: Reception and Redaction in Cuneiform and Israelite Law," Journal for the Study of the Old Testament 57 (1993): 3-22; Finkelstein, "Sex Offenses," 362-64. 51. Pressler, "Sexual Violence," 107-108. 52. The logic of Middle Assyrian Laws (MAL) tablet A, paras. 12-14 closely resembles that of Deuteronomy 22:23-27 (B and B'). If the illicit encounter takes place in the other man's house (cf. "in the town"), the wife is deemed complicitous; they are both put to death (para. 13). If it takes place in the main thoroughfare and it is a forcible encounter (cf. "in the field"), only the man is put to death (para. 12). Paragraph 14 adds a further distinction: If the illicit encounter takes place in either the thoroughfare or an inn and the wife (it is implied) is deemed complicitous, the husband determines the punishment of both parties, which shall be identical. Why does this case not require the death penalty? Paragraph 13 demonstrates that it is not because the supposed "rape" in para. 12 requires a more serious penalty. Rather, the relevant legal distinction has to do with the respective location of the two crimes in paras. 13 and 14. I suspect that the wife's entrance into the man's home (para. 13) was taken to be unequivocal evidence of a premeditated act within an ongoing relationship. The nature of a meeting in a public space (para. 14) is ambiguous; it could be interpreted as a type of "crime of passion," a mere momentary indiscretion. It fell to the husband to decide. At any rate, in all three cases, the wife is merely a moral agent who might be guilty; she is not a legal entity who might be a victim; that privilege is reserved for the husband. The pair of cases in the Laws of Ur-Namma, paras. 6-7, which deals with the question of initiative, similarly views women as moral agents without legal status. If the "wife" (dam) of a "young man" is "deflowered" by another man, the latter is put to 16</page><page sequence="17">Could a Woman Say "No" in Biblical Israel? While one cannot simply combine Priestly and Deuteronomic laws into a coherent whole, Leviticus 19:20-22 nicely complements the Deuteronomic stipulations on "deflowering" a virgin engaged to another man. If the betrothed virgin is a slave who has neither been "ransomed" nor granted her "freedom," her violation is no longer a capital offense. Apparently, her status as someone else's property impinges on the bridegroom's normal claims over his prospective bride. The law betrays no interest in her complicity, perhaps because neither she nor her partner will be executed in either case. And since Priestly law concerns itself pri- marily with offenses against God (rather than civil offenses against one's neigh- bor), it does not even stipulate a fine payable to the slave's owner, only a "guilt offering" to Yahweh. While A does not specifically address the wife's "complicity," I infer that it recognizes the possibility of her innocence, partly by invoking the principle of intellectual charity, partly by invoking the legal principle demonstrated in B and B': If the wife is not complicitous, she is innocent and therefore not to be punished, as was the case in B'.53 Here one should also consider the Priestly Sotah ritual (Numbers 5:12-31), which complements the Deuteronomic ruling. The impor- tance of determining her guilt, whether she has "gone astray" ( tisteh ) and been "unfaithful" (ma'alah bo ma'al , Numbers 5:13), using an oath cum magic potion, suggests that a wife who falls prey to a noncomplicitous encounter would be held innocent and treated as such. A more cynical, less charitable reading is possible, namely, that A demands the woman's death regardless of her complicity, since in either case she has been defiled by the extramarital encounter: "And so you will purge the evil from Israel" (Deuteronomy 22:22).54 However, while this reading would only further underscore the absence of the concept of rape in biblical law, it seems unlikely. In contrast to A, the complicity of the unengaged virgin does not seem to enter consideration in A'.55 This is because it would have no legal consequences death (para. 6) - it does not address the wife's complicity/punishment. But if the "wife" (dam) of a "young man" initiates the sexual encounter, only she is put to death (para. 7). In either case, it is the husband who possesses legal status, he who is the victim. 53. On the elliptical nature of such laws, see Raymond Westbrook, Studies in Biblical and Cuneiform Law (Paris: Gabalda, 1988), 6; Finkelstein, "Sex Offenses." 54. This is Berlin's view in "Sex and the Single Girl in Deuteronomy 22, 103. It so, one might arguably relate this case to Deuteronomy 24: 1^4: If a divorced woman marries a second man whom she then divorces, she cannot return to her first husband, since this would be an "abomination" (to 'evah). That is, it is the sequence of sexual partners (A, B, A) as such that offends God, not the woman's engagement in an extramarital affair. 55. Although the man is said to seize ( vehehzik ) the virgin betore torcibly violating her in B (Deuteronomy 22:25-27), the similar action of "taking hold of her" (utefasah) in A' (Deuteronomy 22:28-29) does not necessarily indicate force: see Berlin, "Sex and the Single Girl," 104, with further references there. True, the two verbs are largely synonymous: S. R. Driver, A Critical and Exe- getical Commentary on Deuteronomy, 3d ed. (Edinburgh: T&amp;T Clark, 1902), 258. And yet, the two closest parallel examples seem to point to a difference in semantic nuance. Thus, Potiphar's wife may act as the sexual aggressor when she "takes hold" (vattitpesehu) of Joseph's clothes, but the 17</page><page sequence="18">Robert S. Kawashima in this situation.56 It would neither change the nature of the crime as regards the male perpetrator - according, again, to the principle of B and B', the punishment would be the same in either case. Nor would it change the treatment of the girl, since in neither case has she broken a vow to a groom.57 For this reason, the perpe- trator is not put to death, as he would be had he "violated his neighbor's wife" (Deuteronomy 22:24). Rather, he must pay a fine of fifty shekels of silver to the girl's father, who is the victim in this instance. The same basic reasoning underlies the Covenant Code's version of this law in Exodus 22: 15-16. If a man "entices" or "deceives" an unengaged girl, he must pay the "bride price for virgins" to her father, though here the father reserves the right to withhold her from marriage.58 I suggested earlier that A' expresses the patriarchal nature of the underlying logic most clearly. This is because it most fully exposes the woman's vulnerability, her lack of options. For what could be more shocking, at least from our modern perspective, than that this girl, who might have been forcibly violated by this man, should be given to the guilty party in marriage? As I observed earlier, however, her refusal does not have legally binding force, and thus it does not add to or in any way alter her attacker's punishment. This law, then, exhibits no awareness of "rape," no fear of trapping the girl in what we would now character- ize as an "abusive" marriage. Rather, it cares for her (as a daughter of Israel) in the only way it knows how: Providing for her future, which has been compromised by this unauthorized sexual encounter, by giving her to a husband who cannot divorce her. In the case of her complicity, one might compare this crime to what we now call "statutory rape." The perpetrator has "violated" her (Deuteronomy 22:29), inasmuch as she lacks the legal competence to enter into "consensual sex." The point, however, is precisely that modern law defines statutory rape with reference to the legal distinction between minor and major, whereas this Israelite girl, in story treats her as physically incapable of forcing the encounter, and so she must content herself with a mere proposition: "Lie with me" (Genesis 39: 12). In stark contrast, when Amnon "seizes" ( vayyahazek ) Tamar (2 Samuel 13:11), the menace of the verbal root is not far off: "And he overpowered her [vayye- hezak mimmennahY (2 Samuel 13:14). However, since neither verb suffices to establish the presence or absence of force, one must ultimately turn to contextual arguments: the most convincing interpretation of Deuteronomy 22:13-29 and the larger legal system from which it emerges point to an opposition between these two verbs within this particular passage. 56. Contra Finkelstein's unconvincing claim: "On strictly physiological grounds, therefore, it would have been unusual for a girl in this age group to seek sexual experience on her own initiative" ("Sex Offenses," 368). 57. The girl's complicity would seem to change the nature of her crime against her father, but the law remains silent on this matter. One should analyze A' in relation to Deuteronomy 22:20-21, its legal complement. If the illicit sexual liaison is transformed into a legitimate marriage, her offense is neutral- ized; if not, she may find herself sentenced to death for her "outrage" against "her father's house" - more on which below. 58. The verb "seduce/entice" (yefatteh ) need not entail the girl's complicity. The prophetic report that God wants to "entice" Ahab into a doomed battle (1 Kings 22:20) supposes that Ahab would willingly approach the battlefield, but not that he would willingly submit to defeat. Thus, Amnon 's forcible violation of the unwilling Tamar is most likely covered by Exodus 22:15-16, inas- much as he created a ruse that lured her first into his home, then into his chamber (2 Samuel 13:1-14). 18</page><page sequence="19">Could a Woman Say "No" in Biblical Israel? contrast to her modern counterpart, will never become an autonomous woman, save through the unenviable event of divorce or widowhood.59 Finally, as the careful reader will have already noticed, the chiasmus out- lined above omits one combination of features: - married, - virgin. This is the burden of Deuteronomy 22: 13-21 : the "outrage" (nevalah) of a girl losing her vir- ginity before consummation of marriage, "fornicating [liznot | while in her father's house [beit ' aviha ]" (Deuteronomy 22:2 1).60 If the man's accusation that his bride was not a virgin is true, it bears witness, after the fact, to the bride's involvement in a previously undetected event: B, B', or A'. If she was a willing sexual partner with a man while engaged to another (B), her reason for keeping the encounter a secret is obvious: She would have been put to death, and so she has at least managed to delay her exposure and execution. The lesson, of course, is not to commit an infi- delity against one's fiance. If she was forcibly violated while engaged to another man (B'), the law encourages her to report the incident; otherwise she may be held guilty at a later date (Deuteronomy 22:21).61 Finally - and this seems to be the primary intent of the paragraph - if a sexual encounter takes place while she is unengaged (A'), the law encourages her to report the incident, so that proper marital arrangements can be made with this first sexual partner, thus salvaging her honor. Even if she did not willingly participate in the encounter itself, her sub- sequent silence makes her, in effect, an accomplice in this "outrage," this act of "fornication" against her father's house. Even if she was the unwilling object of a crime, she is now treated as an "evil" to be "purged" from Israel (Deuteronomy 22:21). Conversely, if the husband is guilty of making a false accusation, he will be flogged and fined one hundred shekels of silver "because he has given a bad name to a virgin of Israel" (Deuteronomy 22:19). Again, the fine is payable to the victim, the bride's father. In fact, this act of slandering a virgin bride is struc- turally identical to "deflowering" her outside of marriage (as in A'): it retroactively transforms the consummation of marriage into a "violation" of the bride, inasmuch as the would-be groom attempts to "use" her sexually without the follow-through of marriage. For this reason, the same punishment is imposed in both cases: The guilty party must pay a fine, and he forfeits any right to divorce. Indeed, slander is the more serious offense, as reflected by the heavier fine and the addition of cor- poral punishment. This punitive supplement appears to answer to the crime of slander itself.62 59. For the same reason, one might add, B and B' makes no distinction between the "forcible" and "statutory" violation of an engaged virgin: The crime is defined with respect to the husband, not the virgin girl. 60. For a thorough treatment of this case, see Bruce Wells, ' Sex, Lies, and Virginal Rape: The Slandered Bride and False Accusation in Deuteronomy," Journal of Biblical Literature 124 (2005): 41- 72. 61. According to MAL A para. 23, if a woman is forcibly violated by a man, she must demon- strate her innocence by making the incident known as soon as she leaves the crime scene. In precisely this way, Tamar, immediately upon being cast out of Amnon's house, undertakes a ritual of public mourning: putting ashes on her head, tearing her robe, etc. (2 Samuel 13:19). 62. See MAL A para. 18: slander is similarly punished with flogging and a line, in addition to "the king's service" and cutting off the perpetrator's hair (public humiliation). 19</page><page sequence="20">Robert S. Kawashima While the Mesopotamian legal views on these matters fall beyond the limits of the present study, it is useful, for the sake of some comparative perspective, to make a few tentative remarks. Let us consider a case from MAL A, which might seem to provide evidence for the concept of rape: the violation of an unengaged virgin (paras. 55-56).63 Unlike Deuteronomy 22, MAL A differentiates between the viola- tion of a girl who is willing as opposed to one who is unwilling, at least in terms of the perpetrator's punishment. But does this make her a fully constituted legal entity? And does it establish the existence of the concept of consent? In fact, in both cases the law still identifies the girl's father as the victim, in whose "house" she is said to reside.64 If the girl was the unwilling object of a sexual violation (maza w), the wife of the offender is to be sexually violated (maza 'u) as well and subsequently kept by the victim (the father), while the girl enters her attacker's house as his dependent.65 It may appear at first glance that the law, in "talionic" fashion, is inflicting the girl's suffering upon her assailant, thus treating her as the victim, but in fact, it is her father's losses that are being paid back in kind: It is not the guilty man who is vio- lated, but rather his innocent wife, because this more accurately "mirrors" the crime against the patriarchal household; the two houses involved effectively exchange the wife and the girl; if the man is single, he must pay damages to the father and, at the latter's discretion, marry the girl as well. If the girl was willing, conversely, the wife is not touched, but the man must still pay damages to the father, who in turn punishes his complicitous daughter as he sees fit. The latter punishment (and therefore crime) may seem less severe, but in fact, it is identical to that of a single man who forcibly violates a girl, so the law does not treat this case as a genuinely lesser crime. What one really witnesses here, once again, is the precise calculation of the most appro- priate mirror punishment: Since the victim's daughter was not forcibly violated, neither is the criminal's wife; and, given the elliptical nature of these laws, if the man is single, he most likely has to marry the girl as well, if the father so wishes. To the extent that the girl's suffering is taken into account by MAL A, it recognizes her personhood - certainly more so than Deuteronomy 22 - but grants her neither autonomous legal status nor the power of consent. As a final piece of evidence in support of my reading of Deuteronomy 22, let us turn to Amnon's violation of Tamar in 2 Samuel 13, an incident that would seem to constitute incontrovertible proof of the existence of the concept of rape and of female consent.66 The sexual crime in this episode plays out like A' above (- engaged, + virgin). Amnon sets a trap for Tamar, tricking their father, 63. See Finkelstein's scattered remarks in "Sex Offenses." 64. While Martha Roth explicitly addresses the question of "legal personhood," she seems to take for granted the modern concept of individual rights: see "Gender and Law: A Case Study from Ancient Mesopotamia," in Gender and Law in the Hebrew Bible and the Ancient Near East, ed. Mat- thews et al., 173-84; and "Mesopotamian Legal Traditions and the Laws of Hammurabi," Chicago-Kent Law Review 13 (1995-96): 27. 65. Both Roth ( Law Collections ) and the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary translate this verb as "rape," but this merely begs the questions that I have posed and attempted to answer here. 66. Cf. Frymer-Kensky's very different reading in Women , 160-69; and Lipka's in Sexual Transgression , 203-23. 20</page><page sequence="21">Could a Woman Say "No" in Biblical Israel? King David, into sending his half-sister to his home in order to nurse him back to health. By clearing his inner chamber of those who might come to her aid, he effec- tively creates the situation of the "open field." The crime that follows is unambigu- ously violent and forcible. Tamar clearly refuses Amnon's proposition: "No, my brother, do not violate me [te'anneni]; for it is not done thus in Israel. Do not do this outrage [ nevalah ]" (2 Samuel 13:12). Amnon in no uncertain terms "overpow- ered [vayyehezak] her" (2 Samuel 13:14). But does the narrative itself actually con- ceive of it in anything resembling modern terms? The reasons Tamar offers for refusing her half-brother are instructive. She does not refer to her own volition - nor, for that matter, to the question of incest - which is irrelevant. That which is "not done in Israel," it turns out, is failing to procure the consent of the father: "Speak, please, to the king; for he will not withhold me from you" (2 Samuel 13:13). True, one might interpret her remarkably articulate response as mere rheto- ric, an attempt to forestall the impending assault, but the principle of verisimilitude still suggests that David, as patriarch of the house, is the legal entity who matters. More shocking still - at least from our modern point of view - is Tamar 's reaction to the violation itself. She makes no attempt to escape her assailant and shows no interest in having him duly punished. Rather, what she wants and expects is to remain in Amnon's house as his wife. Indeed, she views his refusal to marry her as more despicable than his first crime (2 Samuel 13:16). As we have seen, however, in all of this she merely follows the legal conventions of the time (Deu- teronomy 22:29). But then we must conclude that Tamar had no power of consent and that her violation did not constitute a forcible rape. Conclusion In fact, one should in this fashion - in light of the genealogy of legal status - revisit and reevaluate numerous so-called "texts of terror."67 Far from providing an apology for these texts or an anodyne for their ethical deficiencies, this approach places the maltreatment of women in proper historical and comparative perspec- tive. This maltreatment, rather than being a superficial and localized expression of the ethical shortcomings of a specific culture and its laws (in ancient Israel, for example) or of certain writers and their more or less fictional characters (e.g., the J source), is the logical outcome of a fundamental and widespread gap in legal and ethical thinking. The approach taken here thus provides a viable alternative, on the one hand, to criticizing the past for not being more "modern" - which criticism, even when defensible in itself, has no ethical value, as I once heard Noam Chomsky observe in an interview apropos of our penchant for criticizing other nations' policies - and, on the other, to remaking the past in our own image.68 As for the project of genealogy itself, this study constitutes only one small chapter in that larger history culminating in what we now refer to as universal 67. See, e.g., Phyllis Trible, Texts of Terror (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1984), 37-63. 68. On the latter error, see Robert S. Kawashima, "A Revisionist Reading Revisited: On the Creation of Adam and then Eve," Vetus Testamentum 56 (2006): 46-57. 21</page><page sequence="22">Robert S. Kawashima human rights. I have approached this early "chapter" specifically through the con- ceptualization of women, in order to bring into clearer relief the lineaments of the patriarchal household. Of course, a great distance lies between this ancient con- figuration and the modern idea of individual rights, which raises certain interesting questions. Over the centuries, how has legal status been successively redefined and redistributed? In what configurations have "sex crimes" and other forms of "assault" been conceived of? Will the very notion of "rights" one day become a thing of the past? I suspect that carefully analyzing the changing fortunes of women would continue to be instructive in the ongoing search for answers to broad questions such as these. For example, by the Second Temple period, as John J. Collins has observed, there is evidence that women, at least in some com- munities, had the "right" to (i.e., could initiate) divorce, which logically presup- poses women's "consent" to marriage.69 This development implies a great deal beyond divorce and marriage as such, which should be explored from the perspec- tive of the genealogy of legal status. It constitutes, in Lacan's words, one of those moments "when the woman begins to emancipate herself, when she has the right to property as such, when she becomes an individual in society" - in other words, when "the significance of marriage . . . [is] abraded."70 Robert S. Kawashima University of Florida Gainesville, Florida 69. Collins, "Marriage, Divorce, and Family in Second Temple Judaism," in Families in Ancient Israel , 107-22. A passage such as Laws of Hammurabi paras. 142-43 (early second millennium BCE) might seem already to grant women the right to divorce - see Westbrook's discussion of the overall question in Old Babylonian Marriage Law (Horn, Austria: F. Berger, 1988), 79-85 - but it would be more accurate to say that it merely gives them occasional permission instead. Thus, it specifies a precise set of "marked" conditions that must be met if a woman is to be allowed to divorce her husband, if she is "circumspect" while he is "wayward and disparages her greatly." And it vests the power to make this determination in certain "authorities." In a telling contrast, the husband's access to divorce is best described, linguistically speaking, as the "unmarked" case: He could decide for himself and without cause, albeit not without material consequences (forfeiting the dowry, etc.) - see Westbrook, Old Babylonian Marriage Law , 69-79. Only such freedom as this is worthy of the name "right." Note, LH paras. 142^3 would actually seem to deal with the annulment of an unconsummated or "inchoate" marriage, not divorce as such - see Westbrook, Old Babylonian Marriage Law , 14-16, 45^6; and "Adultery," 572-73 - but the distinction between permission and right remains. 70.
