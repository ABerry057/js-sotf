Albany: SUNY Press, 1999. xiii, 306 pp. While The Star of Redemption is widely recognized as a great work, if not the single greatest work of modern Jewish thought, it has persistently had diffi- culty finding its readers. Written in an almost private language for a circle of friends and relations, it has taken almost a century to gain an audience that can find a way into its imposing architecture. The situation began to change in 1982 with Stephane Moses' System and Revelation, which offered a detailed reading of the whole text. I, for my part, tried to offer a philosophical interpretation of the method- ology of each of the three parts in 1992, in Correlations in Rosenzweig and Lev- inas; Richard Cohen's Elevations offered a set of readings that linked Levinas and Rosenzweig in 1994. Yudit Kornberg Greenberg contributed a reading that em- phasized the relation to the Kabbalah in her Better Than Wine, in 1996. The decade ended, however, with the two books under review here-both impressive, novel, and complex readings of The Star. Norbert Samuelson has given us a paragraph- by-paragraph paraphrase-or perhaps we need a new term, for Samuelson's book is a real commentary, leading us through the text and offering insight continuous- ly, as well as pausing at key moments to guide us into richer connections. Ernest Rubinstein, for his part, has offered a demanding and challenging book that inter- rogates The Star, reading it not once but twice, and each time not only introduc- ing the various key concepts and developments, but also measuring Rosenzweig against a rich theoretical framework. Many readers, when confronting The Star, have concluded that despite its reputation, the text is intractable. Rosenzweig did not simply present an argument or describe Jewish reality of his time. On the contrary, The Star itself is a special kind of writing, a kind of performance, in which the reader is not only confused, but is led, questioned, exhorted, and commanded. It leads through different kinds of thinking (and so kinds of writing), and switches the reader's perspective boldly. It demands a great deal of its reader, but offers to us a real teaching: about God, about ethics, about art, about being Jewish, and finally about the meaning of our existence. Its complexity requires not just one reading, but several, and not just one 206</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews reader but several. That is why with the publication of these works (and a few oth- ers of similar worth), we only now can really begin to form the set of readings that will allow us to plumb this great text. Samuelson's paraphrase/commentary is itself a group enterprise, as he ex- plains: He was the editor and scribe based upon line-by-line readings done by grad- uate students at Temple University over an extended period of time. Samuelson's interest in contemporary science and in the relation of Jewish thought to such sci- ence illumines much of Rosenzweig's book-the paradigms of quantum mechan- ics, differential equations, and biological processes, to say nothing of infinitesi- mal calculus, all contribute to our understanding of the reasoning of The Star. In Samuelson's work, we see a Rosenzweig who can speak to contemporary Ameri- can philosophy and who forges a way of bridging traditional Jewish thought and modern science. This reading of Rosenzweig allowed Samuelson to write Judaism and the Doctrine of Creation (1994). Its greatest insight for new readers comes in the discussion of creation (Part II, Book 1) and in its ongoing clarity on the role of mathematics as organon of thought. The text, moreover, pays careful and rigorous attention to the epistemological level of The Star, an attention that brings wonder- ful light into some of the murkier places; even in the more accessible passages it teaches us a sobriety about the way that Rosenzweig is interpreting experience, love, prayer, and so on. Samuelson discerns just how rigorously philosophical the whole book is. Moreover, there is another level of his reading that demands mention: the careful attention to the Jewish texts upon which Rosenzweig is drawing. Samuelson is not simply providing another list of sources; rather, he identifies the specific words and phrases (and transliterates them in brackets), to show how much Rosen- zweig is thinking in Hebrew. His long quotation of the Alenu (pp. 265-266) stands out, for Samuelson has re-thought both the traditional prayers and the question of Rosenzweig's interpretation of them. His reading allows us to see Rosenzweig con- necting to traditional Jewish texts (prayers, biblical texts, talmudic passages, and medieval philosophical texts). As interesting as it is to find Rosenzweig engaging contemporary philosophy, it is still more rewarding to begin to see him reinter- preting the Jewish tradition, focusing on words that everyone prays in Shul. Samuelson's voice sounds in the text, displaying in Rosenzweig's book his own unique combination of philosophical interests and Jewish life. Rubinstein offers a quite distinct and important vantage point, exploring the romantic dimension of Rosenzweig's work. Starting from Leo Baeck's essay "Ro- mantic Religion," Rubinstein first assesses how well The Star fits its characteri- zation of romantic. The trip is long and demanding, more valuable than the result, which is a qualified "no." But he then sets sail again, with the question of whether Schelling, in The Philosophy ofArt, was a Baeckian romantic, for which the an- swer is still more clearly, "no." And so only one more voyage is undertaken: but is The Star a Schellingian romantic text? If I tell you that again we have a sort of"no," you will not yet have been to sea. For no simple identification or refusal of iden- tification works because the voyages penetrate Rosenzweig's work with such sub- tle acuity and bring back such great treasures, that we really begin to see how com- 207</page><page sequence="3">AJS Review plex the relation of romanticism and idealism is, and how Rosenzweig's aversion to idealism depends precisely on a flirtation with and an inversion (a romantic trope, as Rubinstein explores) of it. What Rubinstein manages to achieve in this complex set of readings is to in- terrogate The Star in relation to romanticism and to find a place for Rosenzweig in the context of German intellectual history. The position of Baeck, by the way, ends up reduced to a heuristic, because its polemic against his contemporary Chris- tian culture is not explored in its context, and his essay is not flexible or rich enough to fit Schelling, or even Rosenzweig. But in Rubinstein's exploration of Schelling, and in particular in the last voyage with Rosenzweig, we are given not only a much richer interpretation of their relation than heretofore, but also great insight into the way that romanticism can be entertained. More important still is the doubled reading of Rosenzweig that Rubinstein offers on that last voyage, first in terms of philosophy and then in terms of art. This is not merely a clever way to distribute Schelling's The Philosophy ofArt; it also gives the best reading we have of what Rosenzweig is doing with aesthetics in The Star. For both philosophy and art offer in Part I a language prior to language, a prophecy of what happens in the experiences of speaking in Part II, and so they re- main underlying structures throughout Part II and Part III. Rubinstein persists in interpreting the changing role of aesthetics in The Star until he reaches the zenith in the discussion of dance and the gesture. Here, Rubinstein's own book breaks out of its rich and careful negotiating of German philosophical and theological con- ceptuality, as he turns to literature (Keats, Proust, Cather: p. 254) to make his point about the power of minute gestures to connect with whole worlds. Yet, both Samuelson and Rubinstein miss a truly wondrous irony in Rosen- zweig's text, for the zenith of dance is the Hasid's dance and both readings could intersect. At the climax of Christian aesthetics, Rosenzweig writes about the dances on Simhat Torah, saying: "here the dance too could develop as a cultic act, to wit in the dance of the Hasid, who 'praises God with all his limbs.' Dance thus finds a place in the religious service itself only among us ... " (Hallo trans., p. 373). Regardless of how Rosenzweig must then move on to the Corpus Christi pro- cessions into the town from the church, we might well pause to see how Jewish aesthetics interrupts this account of art and Christianity. That interruption is fla- grant here, for the image of a hasid dancing is not merely foreign to German Jew- ry, but it is the very image for German culture of the aesthetic poverty of Judaism. Rosenzweig notes that Christians cannot really dance in their service, so they sub- stitute baptism and processions, but Jews reach the high point of aesthetic vision. As a devoted student of Rosenzweig's The Star of Redemption, I must hon- estly admit that there are few sentences in it that do not open onto whole dimen- sions of reflection, like an intellectual hologram. This pair of clauses about the hasid dancing is one of hundreds, even thousands, of windows. I mention it here not as a rebuttal of either the commentary that had to hurry past it (despite Samuel- son's ability to enhance our understanding of the Jewish sources of the book), or of the complex exploration of art that did not take note of this interruption of Chris- tian aesthetics by a counter-icon of beauty, but only to underscore how our work of interpreting Rosenzweig is far from complete. This one sentence intersects the 208</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews perspectives of our two authors, but also crosses it with reflection on the cultural rhetoric of Rosenzweig's time, as well as offering further reflection on the two re- ligions and even on the German Jewish attitudes toward the Eastern European Jews. Each of these books offers a new valuable reading of this truly great and dif- ficult book, helping to draw readers into it and through it. No reading will be con- clusive, and some may appear that will be better attuned to The Star, but Rubin- stein's ultimate conclusion stands and justifies not only his hard work in building his argument and also the serious labors of reading by Rubinstein, Samuelson and his students: Rosenzweig's Star of Redemption deconstructs itself in order to pre- vent achieving romantic closure. The Star as a text holds itself open, and these two readings help open it to new readers. Robert Gibbs University of Toronto Toronto, Canada</page></plain_text>
