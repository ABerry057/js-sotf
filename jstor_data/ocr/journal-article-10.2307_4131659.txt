<plain_text><page sequence="1">Chaim I. Waxman. Jewish Baby Boomers: A Communal Perspective. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2001. vii, 221 pp. Chaim Waxman's study of American Jewish baby boomers is one in a series of books whose data are derived from the 1990 National Jewish Population Study. This rich data set draws on a large sample of American Jews and provides a bench- mark for understanding many of the critical issues in American Jewish life. Waxman's study is comparative along two critical dimensions. He compares Jewish baby boomers to non-Jewish baby boomers and to the generation of American Jews that preceded the baby boom, which he calls the prewar gener- ation. He also offers a variety of other important comparisons, such as by gender and by denomination. Waxman's work on the baby boom is part of a small but growing body of literature on this generation. On the whole, his research portrays a shift between the generations that marks the baby boomers as far less ethnically identified as Jews than previous generations. Like other scholars, he pays close attention to the impact of the end of cultural consensus beginning in the 1960s. This 220</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews fundamental undermining of authority changed American Jews' relationship to their community, to Israel, and to the synagogue. Waxman thus sets out to explain a central enigma. Jewish baby boomers, for all their defections from com- munal life, are still interested in religion and identify themselves as members of and participants in Judaism, but they appear to observe the laws and requirements of Judaism rather minimally. One of Waxman's most interesting findings demonstrates that Jewish baby boomers are, in many Jewish matters, more similar to than different from the prewar generation. Although they are significantly less religiously oriented than Protestant and Catholic members of the cohort, they are remarkably similar to the prewar generation religiously. Insofar as behavioral measures such as attending a seder or lighting candles on Shabbat measure Jewishness, there is parity between the two generations (68). Jews in the prewar cohort are more likely to be Conser- vative than those in the baby boom cohort, but, for example, in each cohort, the percentage who are Orthodox is virtually identical. Their observances of ritual activities are also strikingly similar. The difference between the cohorts lies in social structural features. Jewish baby boomers do not, as has been well established, live in Jewish neighbor- hoods. Members of the baby boom cohort work in a greater range of occu- pations than the prewar cohort. These two aspects of Jewish life-residence and work-were, according to demographer Calvin Goldscheider, a strong basis of cohesion for another generation. They do not function similarly for the baby boomers. Other changes are less subtle. Above all, attachment to Israel has changed dramatically, as measured by attitudes and travel there. And to no one's surprise, the proportion of nonconversionary intermarriages is far higher among the baby boomers than among those of the older cohort. Waxman's most interesting analysis focuses on Jewish baby boomers' "reli- gious" lives. He argues that this generation is a particularly important one: Its members were born after the Holocaust and came of age during the remarkable cultural upheaval of the 1960s. Baby boomers are highly educated and have achieved considerable occupational success. Their Judaism is likely to influence American Jewish life well into the first third of the twenty-first century. Waxman's analysis draws on the extensive sociology-of-religion literature on the baby boom generation and often effectively reframes it. In the end, he asks whether the best way to untangle Jewish baby boomers' strong religious identifi- cation with minimal commitment is by understanding them as a cohort shaped by unique experiences or by explaining their choices by their historical moment. He opts for the latter and roots his analysis in the work of Ronald Inglehart, who argues that between 1970 and 1986, a variety of social and economic changes transformed the culture of advanced industrial societies. Americans entered a "postmaterialist" world during this period, when, following Abraham Maslow, he argues that questions of meaning (hence self-actualization) become prominent. Jewish baby boomers' increasing personalism-what Steven Cohen and Arnold Eisen called "the sovereign self' in The Jew Within-is the foundation of baby boomer Judaism. 221</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Inglehart historicizes Western religion, but his recourse to a "psychomateri- alist" explanation lacks appropriate complexity for two reasons. One could not characterize the early twenty-first century as postmaterialist. Desire in its econo- mic and emotional dimensions seems to have expanded infinitely. It is not so simple to assume that some needs are "objectively" met when "needs" have been radically redefined in the United States, and consumption has become coterminous with meaning making. Larger cultural and social explanations are indeed appropriate, but baby boom trends cannot be easily contained by recourse to a "hierarchy of needs." The postmodern global world is polarized between ethnic nationalism and new dimensions of identity created by consumerism and an obsession with style, as well as changing forms of association. What undermined authority might well be certain social and technological changes, but it was also tied to the most signifi- cant events shared by the baby boom generation, and it did indeed shape an approach to Jewish life that is more decentralized and even innovative, as opposed to simply "personalist." In addition, as the data reveal, these attitudes are partly shared by both cohorts, baby boom and prewar. Indeed, the seeds for many of these changes were certainly planted in the very suburbs and socialization that one generation provided for the other. Waxman's book makes a real contribution to any under- standing of Jewish baby boomers. He offers one more critical piece of the puzzle about the baby boom cohort. But the puzzle remains far from complete. Riv-Ellen Prell University of Minnesota Minneapolis, Minnesota</page></plain_text>
