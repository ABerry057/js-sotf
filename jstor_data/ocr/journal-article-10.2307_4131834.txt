"Experience taught," von Tre- itschke averred that these Polish Jews were alien to the "Germanic soul." He had nothing against Jews, "baptized and otherwise," such as Felix Mendelssohn, Gabriel Riesser, and others, all of them "fine specimens of the German man in the best sense of the term." But then there were all the others, etc. These are sentences taken from Treitschke's November 1879 essay "Unsere Aussichten," subsequently triggering the debate that has been known since Walter Boehlich's first edition of source materials' as the "Berlin Anti-Semitism Dispute." There were numerous prominent counter-replies, by Heinrich Graetz, Manuel Joel, Ludwig Philippson, Hermann Cohen, Moritz Lazarus, and others, as well as the "Declaration of 75," and the contrary views put forward by Treitschke's colleague Theodor Mommsen. Nonetheless, research has scarcely looked at many positions expressed at the time, including opinions voiced by Jacob Burckhardt, Johann Gustav Droysen, Seligmann Meyer, Leopold von Ranke, Isaac Riilf, and others. The present volumes present a far more extensive portion of these materi- als than has previously been available. This includes 121 documents from No- vember 1879 to May 1881, with more than a third drawn from mid-November through mid-December 1880, when the dispute between Treitschke and Momm- sen reached its high point. The picture of events we now have points to a new range of diverse intellec- tual motives and strategies involved. We were, of course, familiar with the view of Theodor Mommsen, who left no doubts about his recognition of the legal integra- tion of the Jews into society, while at the same time calling for their voluntary con- version to Christianity. Mommsen considered this being similar to the assimilato- ry gesture in which the North Germans or Hanoverians had been constrained to renounce their special separate existence when they became a part of the German Reich. Ludwig Philippson, editor of the Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums, was emphatically opposed to drawing this parallel between political and religious in- tegration: "does Mommsen actually think that a person's conversion to Christianity is analogous to an official being transferred from his native Schleswig-Holstein to Berlin?" In Philippson's view, the difference could be found in the concept of "con- science" (Gewissen, p. 793); in decisions regarding religion, Gewissen was cen- tral, but not when it came to questions of political adaptation. Somewhat better known was the position of Hermann Cohen, developed in opposition to Moritz Lazarus' essay "Uber den Begriff der Nation." For Cohen, "Kant's nation" was interwoven as a constitutive element with (Protestant) Chris- tianity. In decisive points, the German Jews too were the heirs of Protestantism. But in the Protestant quest for a "more pure form of Christianity" (p. 346, cited from Treitschke), the Jewish knowledge of the One and Only God has to play a key role. To mention one final example, there were also the views of the demograph- er and statistician Salomon Neumann. He demonstrated that there had been no sub- stantial Jewish immigration from the East. However, in Neumann's eyes, figures were not just ciphers. Statistical quantification was here still a very particular style 1.

Several comments on the technical quality of this present edition are in or- der. For most purposes, the bibliographical data on first and subsequent publica- tion of the texts included are adequate. But the accuracy of the reproduction of the texts themselves, as several sample probes have indicated, is not always satisfac- tory. The tables and index in the appendix are quite useful. Explanatory notes to the texts have helped to clarify many points and call attention to the contemporary historical circumstances and context. However, one drawback here is that in cross- references within the edition, for example, in quotes from one author by another, the editor lists only the relevant document without giving the exact page, leaving the search for the passage to the reader. The historical introduction has an almost amusing aspect: the editor has not taken the quotations he cites, such as those by Treitschke, from his own edition here, but rather refers to the edition by Walter Boehlich, which this new work in fact supplants. In this respect as well, the author would have been well advised to do a final more painstaking editorial review of this otherwise excellent edition.
