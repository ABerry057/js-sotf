Three approaches to interpreting his works have dominated scholarship for the last century. Some read the works as consisting of two essen tially independent oeuvres: halakhic works written for one audience and philoso phical works for another. Thus, Maimonides did not need to be consistent in his views. The supporters of Maimonides the philosopher read his halakhic works as secretly containing philosophical truths consistent with those in the Guide of the Perplexed (referred to as GP herein). The supporters of Rambam prefer to see the Mishneh Torah as the foremost statement of his views and the philosophi cal stance expressed in the Guide as disingenuous. In the words of Menachem Kellner, Maimonides is presented as "everything from a late convert to Kabbalah to a halakhist, who in truth disdained philosophy, to an Aristotelian philosopher, whose own innermost thoughts stood in conscious opposition to normative Jewish teachings."1 To a certain degree, such bifurcation of Maimonides' work has been replaced with an attempt to unify his thought, to argue that there is a consistency of religious worldview in the Mishneh Torah and the Guide. As Lawrence Kaplan has noted, "In the past several decades ... there has been a major shift in scholarly perspective ... we find that this dualistic approach to the question of the relation between Maimonides' halakhic writings and the Guide is almost universally This article began as a presentation at the Midewest Jewish Studies Association (MWJS) con ference held at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati in September 2006. A draft of the article was later shared at a workshop for junior faculty in Jewish studies hosted by the American Academy of Jewish Research and the Frankel Center for Jewish Studies at the University of Michigan in May 2007. I am grateful to the organizers and the participants for their insightful responses. In addition, I would like to thank my colleagues, David H. Aaron, Barry Kogan, Lawrence Kaplan, Haim Rechnitzer, Dana Herman, and Jaqueline Du Toit, for their guidance and help. 1. Menachem Kellner, "Reading Rambam: Approaches to the Interpretation of Maimonides," Jewish History 5 (1991): 73. 117</page><page sequence="2">Jason Kaiman rejected and in its stead a more integrated approach has firmly taken root."2 As Kaplan has shown, this attempt at integration began in the works of David Hartman and Isadore Twersky. As early as the 1960s, Twersky argued for the importance of examining halakhic materials, particularly the Mishneh Tor ah, in light of Maimonides' philosophy and vice versa.3 Concerning Maimonides' view of the relatedness of philosophy and halakhah, he notes, Maimonides was not only unshakably convinced of the indispensability of philosophy for religion and the general nobility of intellectual perfection but was also deeply concerned about the essential relationship or constant intersection of philosophy and halakhah. More precisely, he was constantly aware of the abiding need to nurture such a relationship and to demonstrate with great deliberation and emphasis the inseparability and complementarity of the two apparently discordant but intrinsically harmonious disciplines.4 Twersky, Hartman, and others have labored extraordinarily to change the nature of the scholarly endeavor and, as a result, discussion of Maimonides' thought cannot exclude the Mishneh Torah or the Guide. But from a theoretical perspective, why stop there? This does not constitute Maimonides' only literary output. Therefore, the question arises, what of this output constitutes a window into his religious worldview? Michel Foucault addresses this issue more broadly: Even when an individual has been accepted as an author, we must still ask whether everything that he wrote, said, or left behind is part of his work. The problem is both theoretical and technical. When undertaking the publi cation of Nietzsche's works, for example, where should one stop? Surely everything must be published, but what is "everything"? Everything that Nietzsche himself published, certainly. And what about the rough drafts of his works? Obviously. The plans for his aphorisms? Yes. The deleted passages and the notes at the bottom of the page? Yes. What if, within a workbook filled with aphorisms, one finds a reference, the notation of a meeting or of an address, or a laundry list: Is it a work or not? Why not? And so on, ad infini tum. How can one define a work amid the millions of traces left by someone after his death? A theory of the work does not exist, and the empirical task of those who naively undertake the editing of works often suffers in the absence of such a theory.5 2.

Does the Guide convey his clearest or most thoughtful statement on any given issue? Though the Guide may be Maimonides' most sustained exploration of phil osophy, does this preclude finding a more profound philosophical statement in a responsum, a medical work, or the Mishneh Torah? In light of Foucault's chal lenge, Tzvi Langermann's comments on Maimonides' medical and scientific works are worthy of note. He has argued that these works served Maimonides' philosophy in an essential way: [Maimonides'] philosophy asserts the unity of all truth, that the deity, in keeping with the Arabic usage, is in fact the Truth {al-haqq), and that the religious impera tive to know God is essentially the same as the philosophical imperative to deter mine the truth ... Maimonides affirms that the strongest and securest claims to truth are made by the sciences, most especially the mathematical sciences, whose statements are demonstrated with logical rigor ... Furthermore, the human body is marvelously constructed, and its study is also useful to the reli gious quest. The science of medicine, which conducts this investigation, is also important as a guide for the conduct of a healthy life?a life as free as possible from the physical and emotional disturbances that interfere with religious quest.6 Thus, if medicine as a science is important to the religio-philosophical quest, Mai monides' medical and scientific works should likewise be considered when exploring his thought. Perhaps these works are consistent as well with the views expressed in those of philosophy and halakhah. Similarly, Leon Stitskin has highlighted the importance of reading Maimonides' letters, both personal cor respondence and public epistles, in order to understand his thought: A study of the letters of Maimonides is crucial to an understanding of the auth entic modes of the classical Jewish philosopher. The letters constitute an explora tion into the philosophic and halakhic mind of Maimonides. They reveal an intellectual independence that rejects unsupported, dogmatic doctrinal beliefs, as stifling rational inquiry and impeding skillful application of the sources.7 Stitskin, too, raises an important concern, also seen in the comments of Twersky and Langermann. Maimonides' thought on a subject in a particular discipline cannot be understood properly by reading his works independently. A full understanding of the Guide appears to be impossible without reference to his "nonphilosophical" works. 6.

Because his philosophical works and scientific works also treat halakhic issues, they, too, must be studied alongside the Mishneh Torah. But supposing these works?halakhic, philosophical, medical, scientific, and private and public correspondence?were examined in their entirety, what assumptions might be made prior to beginning? Should uniformity of thought be expected? Should ideas expressed in the commentary on the Mishnah written in Maimonides' youth be consistent with those written decades later in the Guide? Which texts most accurately reflect Maimonides' thoughts? Could he be more honest and revealing in a private letter than in the Guide, which, although written in an epistolary frame, was already made, with his consent, a public docu ment in his own lifetime? Foucault's comments lay the framework for what follows. Beginning with the discussion of Job in GP 111:22-23, this study explores the interrelationship of a broad swath of works in Maimonides' oeuvre, including his commentary on the Mishnah, the Mishneh Torah, the Guide, his medical works, and his personal letters. The purpose of this article is to respond to two questions: First, are there issues that appear throughout Maimonides' oeuvre, and if so, are they treated consistently? Second, how might an exploration of this matter change the way in which Maimonides' comments in one work are understood when his other works are used as explanation? In GP 111:22-23, Maimonides presents the book of Job as a parable devoted to expounding the nature of divine providence. More than twenty scholarly articles have examined these two chapters of the Guide devoted to Job and the vast majority discuss two interrelated issues.8 One is the mechanics of how Maimo nides understands the functioning of providence; the other focuses on identifying Maimonides' position in his exegesis of the biblical book. Maimonides, like Saadiah Gaon, understood the biblical book as a philosophical dialogue in which each of the characters offers an alternative explanation of providence. What remains unclear to many is to which position Maimonides himself ascribed and which character best represents his explanation of providence.9 Most recently, Robert Eisen 's monograph on the place of Job in medieval Jewish philosophy, has, in a superb treatment, shown the tremendous influence that Maimonides' reading of Job had on later generations of philosophically 8. See, among others, Idit Dobbs-Weinstein, Maimonides and St. Thomas on the Limits of Reason (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1995); Hannah Kasher, "Demuto ve-de'otav shel 'iyov be-moreh ha-nevokhim," Da 'at 15 (1985): 81-89; Leonard Kravitz, "Maimonides and Job: Method of Moreh," Hebrew Union College Annual 38 (1968): 149-58; Oliver Leaman, "Maimonides," in Evil and Suffering in Jewish Philosophy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 64-101; Jacob S.

And yet, few have lent serious consideration to Maimonides' treatment of Job as it relates to his discussions of suffering and recovery elsewhere in his work. This lacuna results, in part, from assumptions related to the genre of the Guide. When the Guide is perceived as a philosophical tract, the interpreter expects that it should reveal philosophical ideas. These, for the most part, are assumed to be theoretical and abstract and perhaps even esoteric. As such, the questions explored tend to be philosophical, and the answers are found by refer ence to other passages within the philosophical work. The Guide of the Perplexed deals with much biblical material, but Job receives a particularly thorough and, to a certain degree, unique treatment.11 Two full chapters are devoted to surveying all the characters?the whos, wheres, whats, whys, whens, and hows. Though most scholarly work attempts to understand what Maimonides was teaching about providence, very few works have explored Maimonides' motivation for treating Job. Abraham Joshua Heschel concludes that Maimonides identified with Job and was therefore compelled to write about him. Lenn Goodman and Robert Eisen have suggested that Maimonides was compelled out of philosophical neces sity to respond to his predecessor Saadiah.12 Although both of these views are plausible, establishing which was Maimonides' priority is simply impossible. Ulti mately, Maimonides' reading of Job is forced. The assumptions and conclusions evident in the chapter are already very well established in Maimonides' earlier work, and he continues to maintain them in works produced after the Guide; he simply could not have responded any differently. The remedy he offers for Job's predicament is the same one that he recommends in every case of suffering he discusses in his works, whether it is his own, that of another person, or that of the biblical figure Job. Maimonides' Interpretation of the Book of Job: A Brief Review As a point of departure, and for the sake of argument, it is worth summar izing GP 111:22-23 and Maimonides' exegesis of Job. According to Maimonides' presentation, rather than being a historical figure, Job is a character within an 10. Eisen concludes, "At the center of the tradition of Joban interpretation in medieval Jewish philosophy is Maimonides ... It is his reading of Job that sets the agenda ... and the fact that... writers hark back to Maimonides is an important factor in explaining the commonalities found among their readings of Job" (ibid., 205). 11. Herbert Davidson counts more than 1,500 verses cited and explained in the Guide. Although Maimonides claimed that exegesis was a primary purpose of the Guide (see GP 11:2), modern scholars, with few exceptions, have focused primarily on its implicit purpose, philosophy. See Davidson, Moses Maimonides: The Man and His Works (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), 331-35. In the introduc tion to the Guide, Maimonides states, "This treatise has a second purpose: namely, the explanation of very obscure parables occurring in the books of the prophets, but not explicitly identified their as such" (Shlomo Pines, trans., The Guide of the Perplexed [Chicago: University of Chicago, 1963], 6). Although Maimonides treats much material, only three parables receive extensive discussion: Ma 'aseh Bereishit, Ma 'aseh HaMerkavah, and Job. 12. The perspectives of Heschel, Eisen, and Goodman are treated in later in this essay. 121</page><page sequence="6">Jason Kaiman extended parable about providence.13 Job, who was righteous but ignorant, was caused to suffer with the loss of his family, property, and health. These sufferings were caused by Satan, who Maimonides demonstrates is not a being but rather that which causes evil and appears to be synonymous with privation.14 In the case of Job, he suffers particularly as a result of his intellectual deficiencies. Maimonides makes clear that the key element in Job's suffering is that he saw the functioning of theodicy through the lens of tradition, as the masses knew it, and he assumed that he was suffering unfairly because he was without sin. While Job continued to suffer, four men visited him. In the parable, Job and each of the friends represent a particular view of providence. Job represents the view of Aristotle?providence over the species but not the individual; Eliphaz rep resents the biblical or rabbinic tradition?Job is being punished for his sins; Bildad expresses the view of the Mutazillites?Job is being tested to receive a greater reward; and Zophar presents the view of the Asharites?Job suffers because of God's arbitrary will. Elihu then speaks and God appears. According to Maimo nides, Elihu provides the correct explanation. Proof of this assertion is established by the fact that he, unlike the others, is not chastised at the end of the biblical book. It is at this point that scholarship becomes complicated. Establishing just what the correct view is and how it functions is not entirely clear.15 What is clear is that after God's appearance and his response to Job, Job is relieved of his suffering. As Eisen correctly notes, Most interpreters seem to agree on Job's ultimate lesson. Job learns that one can guard oneself from suffering; however, that protection is not physical, only psychological. This psychological immunity from suffering is achieved 13. On Maimonides' use of allegory as an exegetical tool, see Warren Z. Harvey, "On Maimo nides' Allegorical Reading of Scripture," in Interpretation and Allegory, ed. Jon Whitman (Leiden: Brill, 2000), 181-88. In light of Harvey's conclusions, it would seem that Maimonides would require a text such as Job, which, when read literally, contradicts truths known about God and the world, to be read allegorically or as a parable. It would seem, then, that Job served as an exceptional example for Maimonides to demonstrate how to read a troublesome text correctly according to his her meneutical principles, given that this, in fact, was a significant priority in the Guide. See note 11 herein. 14. On the identification of Satan, see Eisen, The Book of Job in Medieval Jewish Philosophy, 55. He summarizes the views of various medieval and modern interpreters of Maimonides on page 51. According to these, Satan may be equated with privation generally and with privation of wisdom in particular: the imagination, a combination of matter and privation, a combination of privation and imagination, or a combination of harmful chance occurrences and privation. 15. Contemporary scholars disagree about a number of issues, including the nature of Elihu's response and his discussion of an interceding angel who can help alleviate suffering (GP 111:23; and Pines, Guide, 495). See the summary of the various views in Eisen, The Book of Job in Medieval Jewish Philosophy, 57-58. Among the opinions expressed are the possibilities that the angel is the active intellect, the human intellect, or the perfected human intellect. Understandably, the identification of the angel depends largely on how the interpreter views Maimonides' understanding of how provi dence functions. For very different readings, compare Kravitz, "Maimonides and Job," 149-58; and Charles Touati, "Les deux theories de Ma?monide sur la providence," in Studies in Jewish Religious and Intellectual History, ed. Sigfried Stein and Raphael Loewe (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1979), 331-40. 122</page><page sequence="7">Job the Patient/Maimonides the Physician when Job perfects his intellect, contemplates God, and detaches himself from the material concerns of this world so that he is entirely caught up with the pleasure of focusing all his thoughts on the Deity.16 In this statement, Eisen highlighted the key issue: For Maimonides, Job's suffering is psychological. He suffers not because his body is afflicted and his family has been murdered but because he misunderstands and misperceives his situation. The change in psychology cannot cure the illness or resurrect the family, but it can relieve the suffering. What Maimonides prescribes for the sufferer is rational ization of his situation through prioritization. Explaining the Choice to Examine Job Abraham Joshua Heschel and Maimonides 'self-identification with Job In his biography of Maimonides, Heschel suggests that the philosopher's interest in the book of Job resulted from his own suffering. By juxtaposing discus sion of Maimonides' many afflictions and his interpretation of Job in an attempt to establish his state of mind, Heschel creates a rather simple equation: Maimonides suffered significantly, the book of Job is about suffering, hence his interest.17 In the chapter of the biography titled "The Transformation," Heschel argues that the distress caused to the philosopher by the drowning death of his brother David in the Indian Ocean around 117018 forced him to reevaluate his position on the anthropocentric nature of the universe, outlined in his earlier writings. Further, it led him to his discussion of Job in the Guide and to the conclusion that, ultimately, evil itself does not exist. In framing his discussion of Maimonides and Job, Heschel cites GP 111:22, in which Maimonides argues that people respond differently to various degrees of suf fering and that, ultimately, they will challenge divine knowledge and providence because they feel they suffer unjustly. "All thinking men," Maimonides claimed, "are rendered perplexed and helpless by experiences like those of Job."19 Heschel's goal in citing the material is to demonstrate the difference between Maimonides and Job. While many people become troubled by the variety of sufferings they are forced to bear, their perplexity arises from their commitment to "tradition" and its presentation of theodicy rather than to philosophical speculation and its results. Maimonides, Heschel argued, was unlike the "masses" because he did not trust in tradition with regard to the workings of providence, and he understood that money, property, and children are not the things that bring happiness in the 16.

Heschel, Maimonides, 130. 123</page><page sequence="8">Jason Kaiman world. In contrast to the masses, Heschel asserted, "Maimonides never lost his faith in the just and meaningful working of the universe."20 A problem arises, however, in terms of chronology. Heschel's argument relies on the description in the Guide for understanding how Maimonides per ceived the tragedy of the loss of his brother. Maimonides' explanation of suffer ing as laid out in chapters 22 and 23 is the understanding of suffering that Job experiences after the theophany at the end of the biblical book. Similarly, Mai monides composed the Guide long after the deaths of his father and brother. By the time of its composition, toward the end of the 1180s, the events that had led to Maimonides' most extreme suffering had long since past, and his philosophi cal approach to both explaining and coping with suffering was the result of many years of thought. In the period immediately following the deaths, Maimonides was much like the pre-whirlwind Job; both men despaired. Writing GP 111:22? 23, Maimonides was like the post-whirlwind Job. Heschel describes the situation in reverse and, as a result, incorrectly. Furthermore, as Barry Kogan and David Blumenthal have both noted, Heschel's conclusions were based on the material available to him at the time of composition of the German-language volume in 1935.21 The subsequent availability of materials from the Cairo Geniza necessi tates a r??valuation of them. This is particularly true with regard to a letter from David to his brother outlining some rather foolhardy travels and his decision to take the fateful trip to India to recoup his financial losses.22 Kogan correctly noted that Heschel misinterpreted Maimonides' critique of material acquisitive ness in the Guide as self-reflective, resulting from guilt over the drowning death of his brother. Had Heschel had available the letter from David found in the Cairo Geniza, he might have rather interpreted the critique as directed at David, who "let his acquisitive inclinations overcome his better judgment more than once, and the eventual price was the forfeit of his life."23 In truth, the relationship between Maimonides and Job is far more complex than Heschel suggested. Despite his conclusion that David's death forced Maimo nides to treat the issues of evil and suffering, he had already begun to deal with these issues much earlier and in a fashion foreshadowing the argument in GP 111:22-23. The death of his brother and the related tragedies were only some of the tribulations that Maimonides faced, beginning with his family's persecution and flight from Spain. Though he recounted these earlier events elsewhere, he never discussed Job in these contexts, nor, when treating Job, did he ever review his own suffering. However, he had already discovered the explanation of suffering that he would eventually outline more fully in the Guide. This does 20. Ibid., 131. 21.

In an effort to make up for his commercial losses, David decided to risk a trip to India.

Though it was only after the drowning that Mai monides became interested in Job, there are certainly alternative explanations for his choice to expound it. Maimonides ' response to Saadiah Gaon It might be argued that Maimonides turned his attention to this biblical text out of philosophical necessity; in order to present the correctness of his own expla nation of providence, it was essential for him to demonstrate the errors of his predecessors. Although Saadiah Gaon is never mentioned explicitly in the Guide, Maimonides' Letter to Yemen and Eight Chapters make clear that he was familiar with his work.24 As Saadiah treats Job and providence in both Sefer Emunot v 'Deot and in his Commentary on Job, it is possible that Maimonides was responding to the earlier sage's ideas. Eisen has argued that Saadiah's commentary on Job was his fundamental statement on theodicy, not that found in Sefer Emunot v'Deot25 As such, Maimonides may well have discussed Job in order to explain his concerns and to challenge Saadiah's explanation of providence and theodicy and their related philosophical issues. Furthermore, although Maimonides never explicitly cited Saadiah in the Guide, Eisen has demonstrated his dependence on Saadiah for his understanding of Job. He notes that Maimonides was influenced by Saadiah in viewing the middle dialogues of the biblical book as a philosophical debate; in seeing Elihu's position as the correct explanation; and in viewing Job 33 as essential for understanding Elihu's view.26 Additionally, Goodman has asserted that Maimonides had a particularly difficult time accepting Saadiah's conclusions: "No one appreciated Sa'adya's theo dicy more than did Maimonides; but that theodicy, as Maimonides read it, was shot through with alien and unassimilable assumptions."27 Goodman demonstrated that 24. On Maimonides' treatment of Saadiah in the Guide, see the brief discussion by Pines in his translator's introduction to the Guide, cxxxii-cxxxiii. Pines suggests that 1:71 and 111:17 allude to Saadiah's understanding of the unity of God and compensation for this-worldly suffering in the after life. Maimonides' attitude to the geonim is complex. It is clear that he was much troubled by their phi losophical positions, but his response to their legal innovations also suggests that he doubted their legal authority to implement changes in matters of halakhah. See Robert Brody, "Maimonides' Attitude towards the Halakhic Innovations of the Geonim," in The Thought of Moses Maimonides, ed. Ira Robinson, Lawrence Kaplan, and Julien Bauer (Lewiston, NY: Edwin Mellen Press, 1990), 183- 208. The letter, which deals in no small part with messianic speculation, responds explicitly to those calculations put forth by Saadiah in Sefer Emunot v'Deot, chapter 8. A number of parallels to Saadiah's work are found in Maimonides' Eight Chapters. See, e.g., the explanation of hukim in Eight Chapters (chap. 6) as briefly discussed by Lawrence Kaplan, "An Introduction to Maimonides' 'Eight Chapters,'" Edah Journal 2, no. 2 (2002): 21-22. 25.

The pre whirlwind Job is aligned with the Asharite school of thought. The view of Job's friends is similar to the Kalam view that no one suffers undeservedly or without transgression. Even the view of Elihu, which Saadiah "takes to be the truth, the doctrine of divine recompense, takes its text from the rabbinic doctrine of the 'suf ferings of love' but derives its dialectic and even its terminology from the Mutazi lite kal?m."2S Given Maimonides' distaste for Kalam-like understandings of philosophy and theology, it is no wonder that he challenged such a view of provi dence when he ascribes these views to Job's friends and reminded his readers of their erroneous presentations of divine providence.29 As Herbert Davidson has noted, "Notwithstanding [Maimonides'] dismissive attitude toward the school, the Kalam served, at the very least, as a catalyst helping to crystallize his stand on virtually every topic that we might want to call philosophic."30 According to this interpretation, Maimonides needed to negate Saadiah's reading of Job in order to present his own understanding of the parable. Saadiah had used the biblical tale as a case study, and Maimonides chose to treat Job in the Guide in order to expound his view of providence and to counter Saadiah. Both positions have merit. As the scholarly reviews of Heschel's biography show, Heschel too simply psychoanalyzed Maimonides, but he raised an important question about the degree to which an author's own experiences shape the topics he discussed and the details of that discussion. Similarly, Eisen and Goodman raised the issue of authorial motivation, but they remain firmly in the philosophical camp. In their reading, the Guide is a philosophical text, Maimonides is a philo sopher, and the motivation is purely the refutation of a philosophical error. By con trast, Heschel turned to Maimonides' personal letters to shine light on the Guide, seeing both as the very personal written product of an all-too-human author. Although establishing which of these motivations was dominant in Maimonides' formation, if either?there may be other unaccounted motivations?is not poss ible, Heschel's work expands the boundary of acceptable interpretive tools. Turning to the correspondence led him to an interpretation that differs rather sig nificantly from that of Eisen or Goodman. Examining a wider range of Maimo nides' works modifies the picture even more. Maimonides on Suffering Maimonides' exegesis of Job and its presentation in the Guide were com pleted late in his life.31 In his personal letters and biographical notes included in 28. Ibid., 5. 29.

Maimonides' written descriptions of his own suffering show the development of an understanding of providence and theodicy that ultimately received its fullest discussion in chapters 22 and 23 of the Guide.32 In other words, Maimonides' personal experience of suffering?and his response to it? significantly parallel the model he used to resolve the issues raised by the book of Job. Furthermore, key elements of his discussions of suffering and mourning in halakhic contexts exhibit these same patterns, as does his medical work pro duced after the Guide. Knowledge alleviates suffering: Parallels between GP 111:22-23 and Maimonides ' other writings Maimonides dealt most explicitly with his own experiences of suffering in two important places: in the conclusion to his commentary on the Mishnah and in his letter concerning the death of his brother David.33 These documents show a progression in Maimonides' thought about his own suffering and about suffering in general, which he expressed most fully in his commentary on the book of Job in the Guide. The commentary on the Mishnah. In the earliest of the texts, the Mishnah commentary, completed at the end of the 1160s,34 Maimonides added an extensive closing remark with the purpose of assuaging his critics, on the one hand, and encouraging close reading and correction of his work, on the other. He noted that the commentary was written under much duress. In fact, Maimonides wrote that it was primarily composed on board a ship as he fled from place to place: We have already completed this composition as we wanted, and here I request of the Exalted and plea before Him that He will save me from mistakes. And whosoever shall find a place within [the commentary] of doubt or there appears to him a better explanation of a law among the laws that I have explained, may he comment on that, and judge me for merit, because what I have taken upon myself is not little or easy to execute [even] for a person of good judgment and a good sense of discernment. And particularly when my heart (mind) was preoccupied in recent times by the travails of the time and what God decreed for us such as the exile and the wanderings about the world, from one end of the world to the other, and perhaps we have been granted a reward for this thing because exile atones for sin. The Exalted knows that there are some laws among them that I composed their 32.

And I did not describe the situation except to explain my apologies for what is liable to be apparent to an inquirer who will scrutinize it [my work], and it is not fit to blame him [the one who finds an error] for his critique, rather he has a reward from God for this, and he is beloved by me because this is a divine task.35 And what I have described of my situation during the time of composition of this work was the cause my being delayed for a long time.36 Apologetics aside, the passage provides a window into Maimonides' life during the period between his flight from Fez and his establishment in Egypt.37 Most worthy of note is that during this period of upheaval and escape, he continued to devote himself to composing the commentary on the Mishnah and to engaging in Torah study and the study of science. This commitment to expanding his intel lect in the face of suffering becomes fundamental in his later writings, especially in GP 111:22-23. Though it is clear that these travails must have caused him some discomfort and delay, there is no evidence in the concluding note that Maimonides perceived these sufferings as particularly severe for him personally. Where Job does and does not appear: The commentary on the Mishnah and the Mishneh Torah. Although Maimonides discussed his own suffering in the com mentary on the Mishnah, he never discussed Job. Given Heschel's position on the influence of the death of David on his brother's philosophy, an exploration of the possibility that Maimonides self-identified with Job in earlier works is in order. Mai monides composed the commentary on the Mishnah during his own travails. If there was some self-identification with Job, a more extensive discussion of Mishnah Sotah 5:5?the Mishnah's most important discussion of Job?would have provided an opportunity to discuss the biblical figure's significance. The Mishnah states, R. Joshua b. Hyrcanus expounded: Job served the Holy One, blessed is he, only from love, as it is written, Though he slay me yet will I wait for him. [Job 13:15] Thus far the matter rests in doubt [whether it means] "I will wait for him" or 35. Maimonides' attitude toward the critiques of his readers seems to have been maintained throughout his life. In one of his last letters, he wrote to Jonathan ben David HaKohen that, with regard to the Mishneh Torah, he would appreciate "the efforts of anyone who will emulate [Jonathan HaKohen's] example and point out any error he may find in the book. In this manner every ambiguity and confusion will be removed from the text and my principle reason for writing the Code will be accomplished: to clear the path and remove the stumbling blocks in order that students of the Law should not tire of intricate discussions requiring long hours of study which may cause one to render an erroneous judgment" (Stitskin, Letters of Maimonides, 162). 36. My translation; see Yosef Kapah, Mishnah im Peirush ha-Rambam (Jerusalem: Mossad HaRav Kook, 1996), 3:455-56. 37. Davidson noted that the seven-year period included numerous travels for Maimonides, including a visit to Palestine with his father and brother before finally settling in Egypt (Davidson, Moses Maimonides, 148). 128</page><page sequence="13">Job the Patient/Maimonides the Physician "I will not wait"; but Scripture says, Till I die I will not put away mine integ rity from me, [Job 27:5] teaching that he acted from love. R. Joshua said, "Who will take away the dust from off thine eyes, O Rabban Johanan ben Zakkai!?for all thy days thou dist expound that Job served the Holy One, Blessed is He, only from fear, for it is written, The man was perfect and upright and one that feared God and eschewed evil; [Job 1:1] and has not Joshua, thy disciple's disciple, now taught us that he acted from love?"38 This extensive discussion of Job is taken up in even greater detail in B. Bava' Barra' 15b-16a,39 and yet Maimonides offered only a brief philological comment, in which he did not mention the material on Job at all. If there is any place in the Mishnah commentary where Maimonides had the opportunity to treat Job more thoroughly, this text provided entry into the discussion better than any other. There is no evidence of any sort in the Mishnah commentary to suggest that Maimonides at this early stage felt a particular affinity with Job. The only other extended early reference to Job appearing in Maimonides' work is in the Mishneh Torah (Laws of Mourning 13:3): The mourner reclines in the most prominent place (when the meal of comfort is served). The comforters are permitted to sit only on the ground, as it is written: So they sat down with him upon the ground (Job 2:13), and they are not to say anything to him until he speaks first, as it is written: And none spake a word to him (ibid.); Scripture continues: After this opened Job his mouth (Job 3:1) ... Then answered Eliphaz (Job 4:1). As soon as he nods his head, the comforters are not permitted to stay any longer so that they fatigue him not.40 Even here, Maimonides' discussion is no more than a summary of rules regarding the comforting of mourners (as Job's friends did), as they are described in B. Mo'ed Katan 28b. Again, Maimonides had the opportunity to take up the issue of Job but refrained from expounding any further. However, his discussion of the halakhah of mourning most certainly includes a discussion of the relation ship between the intellect and the resolution of suffering. According to the Laws of Mourning 13:11, One should not indulge in excessive grief over one's dead, for it is said: Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him (Jer. 22:10), that is to say, (weep not for him) too much, for that is the way of the world, and he who frets over the way of the world is a fool. What rule should one follow in the case of bereave ment? (The rule is:) three days for weeping, seven days for lamenting, and 38.

The halakhic mourning period provides the mourner a reasonable period to grieve. Beyond that period, the mourner not only grieves his loss but ignorantly challenges the way of the world, or God's ordering of it. The rules are in place to protect the ignorant. They must end their morning because the law requires it. The wise person does not mourn excessively because the way of the world is clear to one who has studied the sciences and philosophy. Interestingly, in this text, Maimo nides pointed to the four things forbidden to the mourner, which include the prohibition against studying Torah or reading the Bible, the Mishnah, Midrash, and Halakhah (Laws of Mourning 5:15-16). Despite the prohibition, so important is Torah study that a mourning teacher is permitted to teach these texts "if he is indispensable to the public."43 In any case, Maimonides' treatment of the law in this instance again highlights his commitment to suf fering as a psychological problem solved by study: The pain of suffering and loss is tempered by knowledge. In the Guide, Maimonides presented this remedy through an extensive expo sition of Job. In the early works, this idea for dealing appropriately with suffering is already evident, although Job almost never appears in the discussion of it. In these texts, Maimonides developed his resolution for the suffering victim indepen dent of Job. It is only in GP 111:22-23 that they are brought together. Maimonides ' letter to Japhet ben Eliahu and GP 111:22-23. We turn now to Maimonides' letter to Japhet ben Eliahu of Acco. The letter provides the closest parallel to the material in GP 111:22-23. It concerns the tragic death of Maimonides' brother and demonstrates his commitment to study as a remedy for suffering in theory and in practice. In this letter, the framework for under standing suffering like Job's already appears to have been in place. It becomes evident in a number of ways: First, in both the letter and in GP 111:22-23, Mai monides highlighted issues relating to the graduation of different types and intensities of suffering. Second, he insisted on the power of study to know God to eliminate suffering. 41. Hershman, Code of Maimonides, 199. 42. Warren Harvey correctly noted that Maimonides the doctor asserted the reason the halakhah ordained a mourning period was that "those who grieve find solace in weeping and in arousing their sorrow until their bodily forces are too tired to bear the affection of their of the soul, therefore the Torah had pity" (GP 111:4; and Pines, Guide, 567). Harvey concluded that the period of mourning in Maimonides' understanding serves a psychotherapeutic service. See Warren Harvey, "Love: The Beginning and the End of Torah," Tradition 15 (1976): 15. For a thorough discussion of the relationship between the treatment of mourning in the Mishneh Torah and the extremely limited concern for the issue in the Guide, see Kaplan, "The Unity of Maimonides' Religious Thought," 393-412. 43. Ibid., 178. 130</page><page sequence="15">Job the Patient/Maimonides the Physician Maimonides' argument that the story of Job is a parable makes Job an every man. This would suggest that Maimonides saw many people in the image of Job (including perhaps himself). However, his ranking of the various events and afflic tions that cause people to suffer is reminiscent of Maimonides' discussion of his own travails: his persecution in Spain, the loss of his brother and patron, and the burden of community leadership. According to Maimonides, Job suffers the variety of afflictions in the story not because they all necessarily happened to him but so that the text could speak to a community of readers who could find their own type of affliction reflected in the biblical book. That is, Job needed to suffer every sort of calamity in order to fill his role as everyman. It is thus the logical outcome of Maimonides' assumption that the story is a parable. Concerning Job's afflictions, Maimonides writes that the book of Job, Graduates [Job's] misfortunes according to the various circumstances of people. For some are not frightened by the loss of their fortune and hold it a small thing, but are horrified by the death of their children and die of their grief. Others support with patience and without terror even the loss of their children, but no one endowed with sensation can support pain patiently. Now all men, I mean the vulgar, glorify God with their tongues and attribute to Him justice and beneficence when they are happy and prosperous or even when they are in a state of endurable suffering. However, when the misfortunes mentioned in Job befall them, some of them become unbelievers and believe that there is little order in all that exists at the time when they lose their fortune, others hold to the belief in justice and order in spite even of their having been stricken by the loss of their fortune, but do not keep patient if tried by the loss of their children. Others again are patient and keep untroubled belief even when they lose their children, but none of them supports patiently the pain of the body without complaining and repining either with the tongue or in the heart.44 Maimonides recognized that not all suffering leads to the emotional, mental, or physical breakdown of the victim. The fact that he was able to continue his study of the sciences and his composition of the Mishnah commentary even while he was fleeing persecution provides ample evidence of such a situation. In the letter to Japhet ben Eliahu, Maimonides expressed the destructive power of increasingly trying situations. The flight from Spain and the related tribulations did not cause his breakdown, but his sufferings, like those of Job, graduated over time. He writes, Since we separated my father died ... Many and severe misfortunes befell me in Egypt. Illness and material losses overwhelmed me. Informers plotted against my life. But the heaviest blow, which caused me more grief than any thing I had ever experienced, was the death of the most saintly man I knew, who was drowned while journeying in the Indian Ocean. With him went 44. Pines, Guide, 487-88. 131</page><page sequence="16">Jason Kaiman down a considerable fortune belonging to us as well as to others. His widow and his daughter are left with me.45 Though the graduation of misfortunes is not laid out identically as in GP 111:22, the closest connection concerns the loss of a child. The description of Maimonides' relationship with his younger brother David, as it appears in the correspondence, is very much a parental one. Maimonides noted in the letter, "He grew up on my knees, my brother, my pupil." Further, the letter from David to his brother in Egypt provided by S. D. Goitein shows a particularly close relationship in which David is quite upset about causing his brother Moses to worry. Concerning the relationship depicted in the letter, Goitein noted, The complete absence of any formal language as accepted in the epistolary style of the epoch even between closest relatives, shows the degree of inti macy prevailing between the two brothers. On the other hand, the authority of the firstborn was paramount. It was he who directed the movements of his younger brother, wherefore David excuses himself again and again for deviating from his instructions.46 Given that Moses had educated David and directed his actions, and given that David was so apologetic and concerned in the letter itself, the relationship appears paternal rather than fraternal. For Maimonides, the loss of the one who had grown up on his knees must have resounded like the death of his own child. It is plausible, then, that Heschel's insights are not entirely mistaken. Maimonides' experiences were much like those of Job. First came the loss of his personal property and his home. Having fled Spain and Morocco, Maimonides, like Job, was without a home and without his property.47 Having lost his father and brother, he, like Job, had lost close family members. The letter also shows that Maimonides, like Job, understood what it was like to be abandoned by his friends in a time of crisis, challenged by them while innocent himself. He wrote of Japhet ben Eliahu, Your gracious epistle reached me but its contents amazed me. You complain about my silence and my failure to ask about your welfare since I left Palestine. Apparently this is a case of one who comes to admonish others but deserves admonition himself. Indeed, you acted treacherously toward others but no one acted that way towards you. Since we separated my father died. We received letters of consolation from distant lands of Idumea and the West but not a word from you ... But despite all that, I complain against no one ... not even you, although you deserve my reprimand more than anyone.48 45. Stitskin, Letters, 72. 46. Goitein, Letters, 207-208. 47. That Maimonides was forced to flee his home added to the intensity of his suffering. In addition to his property, he lost his religious and intellectual community, along with his prestige and position therein. 48. Stitskin, Letters, 73. 132</page><page sequence="17">Job the Patient/Maimonides the Physician Similarly, Job suffered the indignation of being judged by his friends, who, rather than comforting him, accused him of sinful behavior deserving of punishment. Moreover, Maimonides and Job both initially failed in their respective responses to suffering. Job sat scratching his sores and proclaiming his innocence; Maimonides was incapacitated by grief and remained bedridden for more than a year. Clearly, in the wake of his brother's death, Maimonides had not yet internalized the response to physical and emotional pain that he would eventually prescribe for Job. Despite the fact that Maimonides had already begun to lay out the "correct" response in his conclusion to the commentary on the Mishnah, and he had apparently lived it during his wanderings, his graduated misfortunes had accumulated to a break ing point for him. However, from the end of the letter to Japhet ben Eliahu, it is clear that Maimonides had learned his lesson, although it took time. The biblical book suggests that Job's suffering ended when God appeared and he had his property and his family restored or replaced; Maimonides essen tially ignored this final reward. He presented the story as concluding with the theo phany. GP 111:22 reads, [Job] said all that he did say as long as he had not true knowledge and knew the deity only because of his acceptance of authority, just as the multitude adhering to a Law know it. But when he knew God with a certain knowledge, he admitted that true happiness, which is the knowledge of the deity, is guaranteed to all who know Him and that a human being cannot be troubled in it by any of all the misfortunes in question. While he had known God only through the traditional stories and not by way of speculation, Job imagined that all the things thought to be happiness, such as health, wealth, and children, are the ultimate goal. For this reason he fell into such perplexity and said such things as he did.49 Examining Maimonides' conclusion of both his retelling of Job and the discussion of the death of his brother together shows some remarkable parallels. Of the period following the death of his brother, Maimonides writes, "For almost a year after receiving the sad news I lay on my couch stricken with fever, despair, and on the brink of destruction." Though Maimonides suggested in the Guide that this time of affliction should not cause a person to crumble, he, like Job, could not yet see a remedy for his suffering.50 Here in Maimonides' own experience of graduated sufferings, he discovered the point at which he would break down.51 From Maimonides' description of his distress, it might be concluded that at the time of David's death, he still believed health, wealth, and children to be the keys to happiness or that he still knew the deity only through traditional stories. He, like Job, was terribly grief stricken, and yet, again like Job, he discovered that true knowledge of the deity could help overcome suffering and grief. 49. Pines, Guide, 492-93. 50. The letter also stands in stark contrast to Maimonides' assertion in the Mishneh Torah: Laws of Mourning 13:11 that one who engages in extended mourning is a fool. 51. On the accuracy of Maimonides' description of his difficulties, see the biographical survey of this period of his life in Davidson, Moses Maimonides, 28-75. 133</page><page sequence="18">Jason Kaiman Although Job only came to truly know God through prophecy?God communicated with him via the whirlwind?Maimonides' general position is that the expansion of the intellect through study and philosophical contemplation can also lead to true knowledge. The philosopher, like the prophet, can see elements of the metaphysical reality that can alleviate his suffering. While the prophet perceives this knowledge as a lightning flash, and the philosopher sees it only by way of reflection, both nevertheless see it, albeit with different degrees of clarity.52 While the masses may forever have to settle for believing that God rewards the righteous and punishes the wicked and will suffer when their experience contradicts the tradition, philosophers and prophets do not. Job suffered because he was ignorant of the truth, but he was relieved when he came to know it.53 Similarly, when Maimonides recommitted himself to study and contemplation, his most terrible grief was relieved and he could rise from his bed. In the conclusion to the Mishnah commentary, we find Maimonides already dealing with his afflictions by devoting himself to composing it and to the study of science. This remedy for suffering attains a more complex stage in the personal letter under discussion, in which he wrote, "Were it not for the Torah which is my delight and the study of philosophy to divert my grief, T should have suc cumbed to my affliction.'"54 By his own admission, what saved Maimonides from more than a year of debilitating depression was study. It might be argued that this is simply a case of Maimonides distracting himself from his losses by keeping busy. On a certain level, this conclusion is plausible. In fact, for Maimo nides, this was the fundamental issue. Grief at the loss of material things, of tem porary things of this world, is the actual distraction. It takes away from an individual's attempt to know the deity, and this fact should cause him greater suf fering. For Maimonides, true human perfection consists in the acquisition of the rational virtues?I refer to the conception of intelligibles, which teach true opinions concerning the divine things. This is in true reality the ultimate end; this is what gives the individual true perfection, 52. GP, introduction; and Pines, Guide, 7-8. For a discussion, see Kreisel, Prophecy, 212-14. 53. Maimonides' assertion that Job lacked knowledge appears for the first time in his Ma 'amar 'al kidush ha-shem, written in 1160 or 1161, in which he compares Job and the writer of the responsum that he had been asked to examine. According to Maimonides, both men, the respondent and Job, spoke without knowledge. To support this view, he cites Job 34:35, which highlights that Job spoke without knowledge. Though this does not show that Maimonides identified with Job in any way (he begins the subsequent paragraph in the letter by stating that, unlike the respondent, he is not an ignoramus), it makes clear that Maimonides had been thinking about the biblical book even at this early stage in his writing career. 54. Stitskin, Letters, 73. Joel Kramer's understanding of the letter is worth noting here: "Were it not for Torah which is my delight, and for scientific matters, which let me forget his sorrow, / would have perished in my affliction" (Kramer, "Moses Maimonides: An Intellectual Portrait," in The Cam bridge Companion to Maimonides, ed. Kenneth Seeskin [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005], 27; and idem, "The Life of Moses ben Maim?n," in Judaism in Practice, ed. Lawrence Fine [Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2001], 425). 134</page><page sequence="19">Job the Patient/Maimonides the Physician a perfection belonging to him alone; and it gives him permanent perdurance; through it man is man.55 Incapacitated for a year after his brother's death, Maimonides became the Mishnah Torah's fool who mourned too much. As a result, he not only lost David but also a year of study, which prevented him from acquiring the rational virtues and knowl edge of God. Neither Job nor Maimonides recognized how much he had really lost. Only with the realization of that which is truly important could either over come their grief and return to pursuing the "ultimate end." Despite the fact that these ideas were in formation as early as the 1160s, Mai monides never acknowledged that the topic was one he had contemplated over several decades. For him, the issue of divine suffering was resolved in much the same way it was for Job. Job received what was essentially a prophecy. Likewise, Maimonides stated concerning his interpretation of the book of Job, "[See] how these notions came to me in something similar to prophetic revelation."56 Job's situation was resolved by something akin to prophecy for both Job and Maimo nides. Heschel maintained that Maimonides' comments here confirm that he believed he had received a prophecy: Thus, from the very use of the expression "akin" we may infer that he did not receive a prophetic revelation per se, a revelation materially similar to it. For us it is enough that he admitted this much. Let us not forget that "he who pro phesies that which he did not hear through the medium of a prophetic vision ... is a false prophet and is liable to death by strangulation." It is obvious that Maimonides is not indulging in wordplay when he uses the words "akin to prophecy." "Akin to prophecy" is equivalent to prophecy.57 Whether Maimonides really believed he was a prophet has been an open question for some time. Harvey's conclusion appears accurate: I dare to present the matter as follows: if Moses our teacher received the Torah through a unification (to the extent that it is possible) with the Active Intellect, then Maimonides set down the laws of the Torah while also in unification (to the extent that it is possible) with the Active Intellect.58 In sum, whether by his own experience of suffering or by a lightening flash of prophecy like Job's, Maimonides came to resolve the issue of suffering by 55.

Only the victim, be it Maimonides or Job or the reader of the Guide, can alleviate his own condition. Here it is important to recognize that GP 111:22-23 in particular, and the Guide in general, have practical implications. If Job is a parable, an everyman to whom each sufferer can relate, the Guide is a collection of remedies for suffering. The reader of the section on Job should understand that by accepting Maimonides' prioritizations of those things that are true and real and valuable, he will be relieved of suffering but not of the affliction. Though the physical realities may not change?Job's children remain dead and so does David?the losses no longer cause the enlightened person to suffer. In fact, it is clear from the first pages of the Guide that this is its intended use. Like Job, the Guide's intended reader has been misled because he continues to understand the externals of the law, as he was made "to understand them by others."59 As a result, he "[is] left with those imaginary beliefs to which he owes his fear and difficulty and would not cease to suffer from heartache and great perplexity."60 Thus, the Guide functions as the key to the relief of the reader's suffering, providing him the adequate knowledge to overcome it in much the same way that Job is relieved of his suffering, having "known God only through the traditional stories and not by way of speculation."61 As such, GP 111:22-23 and perhaps the Guide in its entirety should be best understood as a remedy for the illness of perplexity, which is really the psychological cause of suffering. If suffering is, in essence, a disturbance of the psyche that can be treated, suffering becomes, in Maimonides' hands, an illness to be cured. Hence, Langermann was correct in his presentation of the intertwined nature of Maimonides' medical writings and his philosophy, and his work produced following the Guide in the field of medicine relies heavily on his conclusions therein. Mental distress and its cure: The Regimine Sanitatis and the Treatise on Asthma. For those who see Maimonides' ideal of overcoming personal loss through the realization that we have not really lost anything of importance as dif ficult and impossible to implement, they can recognize that the formulator of the ideal likewise could not live up to it. However, the proposed remedy for suffering was not simply theoretical; the philosopher in confronting his own tragic experi ences practiced it. In examining the letters Maimonides wrote at the very end of his life, it is clear that he was suffering from a terrible illness. In his last dated personal letter, addressed to Jonathan ben David HaKohen of Lunel in 1199, Maimonides wrote that he had delayed his written response because he had been laid up with an illness for more than a year that left him often bedridden. He was furthermore 59. Pines, Guide, 5. 60. Ibid., 6. 61. A significant number of parallels between this part of the Guide and the discussion of Job are treated by Raphael Jospe, "Sefer 'iyov ke-'Moreh nevukhim' mikra'i," Da at 50-52 (2003): 83-95. 136</page><page sequence="21">Job the Patient/Maimonides the Physician suffering the physical deterioration related to old age: "My youthful energy is gone, I am constantly short of breath, my tongue has lost its elasticity, my fingers are shaky to the point of finding it hard to write even a short letter."62 Despite the illness and the terrible pain it caused him, Maimonides contin ued to study and compose responsa and medical material.63 While Herbert Davidson suggested that he continued to write out of respect for his correspon dents, it may also have been that Maimonides had internalized the lesson of Job.64 Even while he suffered disease and exhaustion in the last decade of his life, his study allowed him to overcome these travails. He seemingly refused to allow his suffering to prevent him from pursuing the "rational virtues and the ulti mate truths of divine things." Succumbing to the afflictions would have been far more troubling to him. In that same letter to Jonathan ben David, he noted that in the period leading up to his composition of the letter, "the beauty and charm of my 'wife' continued to enchant my heart."65 Though he was distracted by illness and professional (medical) commitments, Torah study and its related requirements remained his priority. That the purpose of the letter was to treat matters arising from the Mishneh Torah provides further evidence of his commitment to study even in the midst of pain and suffering. During this period, Maimonides composed a medical work for al-Malik al Afdal Nur al-Din Ali, the son of Saladin. The date of the composition is unknown, although it was most likely written between 1193 and 1198.66 Maimonides diagnosed al-Afdal with melancholy, and the four-chapter regimen was designed to help him overcome the symptoms. In the third chapter, Maimonides provides medical advice specifically for this patient, but it is clear that the remedy could be more broadly construed. He offers the following: On the whole, most of what the public supposes to be good fortune, is in truth misfortune, and most of what they suppose to be misfortune is in truth good fortune. It is not the intention of this treatise to expound the truth of this subject, or to explain it and to teach its way, for much has already been compiled about this in all times and in all learned nations that have studied the sciences. This servant has only meant by these references to suggest training the psyche to restrain the passions by studying books on morals, the disciplines of the Law and the admonitions and the laws spoken by the sages. Thus the psyche will be strengthened and will see the true as true and the false as false. The passions will diminish, the evil thoughts will depart, the depression will lift, and the psyche will dilate in whatever situation a man might encounter. 62. Stitskin, Letters, 161. 63.

See Stitskin, Letters, 164. 65. Earlier in the letter, he notes that Torah study had since his youth been like a beloved wife to whom he was betrothed. 66.

Often they will cease altogether if a person holds the following consider ation before his mind's eye. If one reflects on something and becomes distressed by the thought, and grief, sorrow, and sadness arise in him, this can come from one of two things. Either he thinks about something that has passed, like thinking about what has befallen him from the loss of wealth that was his or the death of someone for whom he grieves, or he thinks of things that might yet happen and fears their coming, like thinking and dwelling upon what might result from the coming of adversity. Yet it is known through rational observation, that thought regarding what has come and passed is of no value at all, and that sorrow and gloom about things that have come and passed are the occupation of fools. There is no difference between a man who is gloomy because of wealth that has perished, and its like, and one who grieves because he is a man and not an angel, or a star, or similar thoughts that are impossibilities.67 Maimonides' treatment of depression has received limited scholarly atten tion.68 That he was committed to the influence of the psyche on the body and of the body on the psyche is absolutely clear. Physical affliction can cause melan choly and depression. Melancholy and affliction can also cause physical distress.69 What is interesting is Maimonides' prescription for the medical disorder of melancholy?study! Similarly, in his Treatise on Asthma, he advises that the cure for mental suffering and agitation lies not in food recipes, neither in drugs alone, nor in regular medical advice. The cure of such conditions belongs rather to other spheres of professional knowledge, by which we mean the philosophical virtues taught by the philo sophers who are engaged in the study of ethics, morals, etc. Undoubtedly, these psychological methods are a greater help in the emotional disorders ... Furthermore, the philosophical virtues guard a man against extreme emotional 67. Ibid., 26.1 would like to thank the anonymous reviewer of my article for directing me to an important parallel to this text in GP 3:12. There, Maimonides' outlines the varieties of evils that befall people. As in the Regimen, Maimonides suggests that knowledge will help the ignorant, who suffer as a result of their misperceptions of the ways of God and the world, and that a balanced life wherein one seeks what one needs rather than what one desires will lead to a comfortable existence. Those who seek unnecessary possessions or physical pleasures will place themselves in dangerous situations to have them, or they will suffer because they cannot have them or when they lose them. This can be avoided by understanding what is of value and shunning that which is not. 68. See, e.g., Samuel Kottek, "Maimonides: Rabbi, Philosopher &amp; Physician," in Sobre La Vida y Obra de Maimonides, ed. Jesus Pelaez Del Rosal (Cordoba: Ediciones El Almendro, 1991), 335-44; and Harvey Kranzler, "Maimonides' Concept of Mental Illness and Mental Health," in Moses Maimo nides: Physician, Scientist, and Philosopher, ed. Fred Rosner (Northvale: Jason Aronson, 1992): 49-58. 69. In the case of Job, suffering and grief resulted both from the loss of his children and from the physical sores inflicted on him by Satan. With regard to Maimonides, physical suffering (he was stricken with fever and could not leave his bed) resulted from the grief caused by the death of his brother. 138</page><page sequence="23">Job the Patient/Maimonides the Physician states. They keep a man from falling into brutish emotionalism on mournful or joyous occasions as happens with the ignorant multitude.70 Maimonides' position here is even better defined. The teachings of the philoso phers can help one suffering mental distress. The ignorant are most susceptible to this type of illness. A troubled psyche most strongly effects persons who were not taught the philosophy of morals or the disciplines and admonitions of the Law, such as women, children, and the ignorant. These, because of the softness of their spirit, are irresolute and fearful, and you find that when some harm comes upon them, and there falls upon them a cala mity from the adversities of the world, their grief is great, and they cry out and weep, and slap their cheeks, and beat their breasts, and often the affliction is so great upon them that some die, either suddenly or after a time, from the grief and distress that possessed them.71 By contrast, the wise man is immune to "brutish emotionalism on mournful occasions." In Maimonides' view, the ignorant do not suffer simply because they are not intelligent enough to find a cure but because their spirits are weaker than those of the intelligentsia. Ignorance is to be treated as a pathogen causing illness. Study contains it, as it contains Satan in GP 111:22. Thus, in Mai monides' medical writings is found the ultimate explanation of GP 111:22-23. The discussion and explanation of providence is not only a remedy for a philosophical problem but the cure for a medical one as well. In interpreting the book of Job, Maimonides is the doctor, Job the patient, and the cure time tested. Conclusion Despite Maimonides' statement that his resolution to the problems of the book of Job came to him in something akin to prophetic revelation, it is more likely that he came to explain Job's suffering and its remedy through an analysis of his own experiences and through his study of halakhah, of medicine, and of philosophy over many decades. Heschel was correct that Maimonides eventually put himself in the place of Job. He, like Job, was a man who suffered a series of afflictions, each one more terrible than the last, who broke down as a result, and who, through knowledge of the deity, overcame the suffering. But Maimonides 70. Suessman Muntner, The Medical Writings of Moses Maimonides: Treatise on Asthma (Philadelphia: Lippincott, 1963), 37-38. In a letter to Joseph bar Judah written in the period of the com position of the Guide, Maimonides offers similar advice. In writing about the death of a little girl (whose is not clear; see Shailat, Tgrot, 260-61), Maimonides tells Joseph not to mourn over any person, male or female. Rather, one should contemplate matters by looking at the goodness of the species and not individual experiences of affliction and distress. When one contemplates the big picture, one sees that the world was created by God and operates in good order. The letter appears as, "Excerpts from a letter to R. Joseph on the Vicissitudes of Life" in Shailat, Tgrot, 262. I extend my appreciation to Lawrence Kaplan for directing my attention to this material. 71. Bar-Sela, Hoff, and Faris, "Maimonides' Two Treatises," 25. 139</page><page sequence="24">Jason Kaiman saw all sufferers in the image of Job. He treated them all as patients, and as a result, his prescription for their suffering was the same he recommended for Job, and the one he took himself. Returning to the questions with which we began this study of the exegesis of Job in the Guide of the Perplexed, there is evidence that there are matters Maimo nides treated throughout his oeuvre. In the case of Job and suffering in general, Maimonides' response is consistent. His writings of all types and genres show a commitment to knowledge as the remedy for suffering. This commitment bore both theoretical and practical significance. In this particular case, he could not have responded to the book of Job any differently. From his personal experience and his medical studies, he knew that all suffering is psychological; Job's could be no different. With regard to approaching Maimonides' works, this case study highlights the importance of Foucault's challenge. Maimonides made fairly extensive com ments about the nature of philosophy in his books designated as medical works, and he made medical statements in the Guide designated as a philosophical work. Comments of both types appear in his letters. These boundaries and genres are far more fluid than they have previously been supposed. As such, the study of any part of the "works" without reference to the other parts is incomplete. Furthermore, the privileging of certain works over others?the Guide over the Mishneh Torah or the medical works over the letters?is shortsighted and lacks merit. Maimonides had an integrated worldview wherein medical knowledge served philosophy and halakhah, wherein halakhah served philosophy and medi cine, and wherein philosophy served halakhah and medicine. Maimonides' general understanding of suffering shaped the way he responded to mourners in matters of halakhah, to the distressed and melancholy patient in his medical practice, to the perplexed student, and to the fictional biblical character in GP 111:22-23. The treatment of any part, without the examination of the broader context of Maimonides' oeuvre, can only skew the interpretation of his thought. If, as a result of Foucault's challenge, we access a clearer understanding of Maimonides' thought by comparing and contrasting a greater selection of his writ ings, a new set of methodological concerns must eventually be explored. The inclusion in this study of Maimonides' personal letters and narratives suggests that his life experiences contributed to his understanding of Job. They equally demonstrate that his earlier studies shaped his response to his experiences and his interpretation of them. That simple assumptions of cause and effect are inadequate for answering the question is absolutely clear.
