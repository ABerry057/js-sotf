Unfinished People: Eastern European Jews Encounter America. New York: Norton, 1996. 310 pp. The 1930s were anxious times for New York's Jews. On average they weathered the effects of the Depression better than other New Yorkers, but they nevertheless experienced the crisis as a vital threat to their still precarious position in American society. Then, too, anxiety came as a legacy of migration bequeathed by the older members of the community to their children, who, in turn, incorporated it permanently into the institutions of Jewish communal life. Anxiety, uncertainty, fear, doubt-these form the theme that unites Beth Wenger's history of New York Jewry during the Great Depression with Ruth Gay's memoir of growing up in the Bronx in the 1930s. New York Jews and the Great Depression offers a well-researched and cogently written argument for the centrality of the Depression in American Jewish history. The downturn was especially jarring because it came on the heels of a period in which Jews had begun to feel themselves well on the way to economic and social success. Moreover, the crash came just as the American-born generation was assuming leadership of the community. The "economic setbacks, stalled mobility, and frustrated expectations" of the 1930s, Wenger argues, "left an indelible imprint on the canvas of Jewish life in America" (pp. 2-3). Focusing on the city in which nearly half of America's Jews lived, Wenger explores their responses to hard times as individuals, in</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 341 their families and neighborhoods, and in their religious and social-welfare institutions. Wenger grapples with a couple of conceptual difficulties in the histo- riography of the Jews and the Depression. First, as she notes, American Jewish history is usually related as a story of steady upward mobility. The Depression, in the common view, was merely a brief pause in the inexorable rise of the Jews that began in the immigrant period and resumed after World War II. Wenger acknowledges that the Depression represented something of an "aberration from the overall pattern of twentieth-century Jewish mobility" (p. 4). Nevertheless, she argues that to look at the Depression only as a temporary setback is an act of anachronistic hindsight that distorts the era's meaning for those who lived through it. The economic crisis, together with the attendant rise in antisemitism, left Jews with an abiding sense of the precariousness of the American dream. A second difficulty arises from the fact that Jews were actually less likely than others to lack employment or to apply for relief. But in perhaps her book's most important contribution to American Jewish historiography, Wenger reveals the diversity of experience that lay behind this apparent statistical reality. She shows that such factors as gender, class, and age conditioned how the Depression affected the lives of individual Jews. Although the majority of the city's Jews wore white collars to work by the 1930s (and were thus well positioned to survive the crisis), New York Jewry still included a relatively large number of manual workers, and these were hit especially hard by the economic crisis. The city's Jewish geography reflected these class differences. A great gap separated the poorest Jewish neighborhoods on the Lower East Side and in Brownsville from the richest on the Upper West Side. Within families, men suffered most from the emotional strains of joblessness, but women bore the extra burdens of contributing to family income and managing households on tighter budgets. Young people "alternated between idealism and despair" (p. 56), often remaining in school so as not to face the job market. When they did look for work, young Jews frequently had to deal with discrimination. As Wenger demonstrates, the Depression made its most lasting impact on the shape of Jewish communal institutions and on the psyches of the young people who lived through it. Forced to find a place for themselves in the New Deal order, Jewish social welfare agencies played down relief activities in favor of counseling. Synagogues continued efforts, begun in the 1920s, to attract members by combining religious and secular functions.</page><page sequence="3">342 BOOK REVIEWS Many young people joined radical or Zionist organizations, prompted by a sense of cynicism regarding America as a land of opportunity. Ultimately, collective anxiety led American Jews not only to political liberalism, but also to a search for stability and security. Several of Wenger's arguments are borne out by Ruth Gay's interesting memoir/history of New York Jewish life. The anxiety of immigrant parents and American children forms a central motif of Gay's book. Each generation, Gay argues, found itself caught between two worlds. Many immigrants, she writes, came to America as teenagers; not fully socialized into their native culture, they were too old to adapt fully to American society. Hence, they were "unfinished people," never at home in either world, always fearful and uneasy. Likewise, the second generation found it impossible to identify fully with their parents' culture, but neither could they feel comfortable in Anglo-America. Gay remembers scouring books in the library for clues about the "real America" outside of her neighborhood in the Bronx. She confesses that she always felt as though she "spoke a foreign language" (p. 67). Gay also testifies to the class-bound nature of New York's Jewish geog- raphy in the Depression era. She grew up mainly in the working-class East Bronx, but her family moved around according to its economic fortunes. The middle-class Grand Concourse seemed a world away. Seeing an advertisement for sealskin coats, Gay mused, "Their wearers must be happy. This perhaps was what ladies on the Grand Concourse wore" (p. 235). The Depression drove Gay's father out of small business and through a succession of jobs. She notes the insecurity felt by workers always on the verge of destitution. Parents and children nearly deified Franklin Delano Roosevelt for the measure of social security he introduced. The second generation also expressed its anxiety by turning to civil service and an abiding faith in meritocracy. As history, Unfinished People leaves much to be desired. Even Gay's basic historical premise-that masses of children and near-children migrated alone, outside of kinship networks and migration chains-is faulty. As memoir, though, Gay's book is engaging, evocative, and often moving. Recollections of small things like hats, beds, floors, and corsets prompt discussions of such larger issues as class divisions in the Jewish community, the aspirations of the second generation to high culture, and the meaning of freedom to the immigrants. Gay helps to demystify the role played by immigrant mothers, often idealized in the memoirs of their sons. The women in Gay's book all have distinct personalities, and express these personalities partly through their cooking and housekeeping. Not all of Gay's female relatives were good</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 343 cooks, a fact which only demonstrates that cooking involved less magic than work and skill. In her chapter entitled "Papers," Gay moves from a discussion of Jewish newspaper-reading habits to a meditation on the ways in which Jews shaped New York, and were in turn shaped by it. The second generation's tireless pursuit of culture and its creative use of the city's public spaces were among its most significant contributions to civic life.
