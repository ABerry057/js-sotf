If the Peninsula had been a swamp of "Egyptian idolatry," the Jewish ex-converso communities in Amsterdam, Venice, Livorno, and London (to name only the most vibrant) were, by implication, encampments on the way to the Holy Land. Yet one aspect of their new condition subtly undermined the ex-conversos' confidence as Jews vis-a-vis the gentile world. Ever sensitive to their image, they were exquisitely aware of their now unambiguous identification in Christian eyes, not with conviction rewarded, not with faith triumphant, but with a defeated and exiled people. One of the interesting responses this double-edged situation produced was the rather fanciful representation of the Jewish community as nothing less than a sovereign republic. Borrowing from the rhetoric of neoclassical republicanism, the authors who adopted this view-admittedly few, but far from marginal--depicted the autonomous Jewish community as a full-fledged In its earliest form, this article was delivered as a paper at a conference on "The Transforma- tion of Jewish Society in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries" at the Van Leer Jerusalem Foundation, Jerusalem, January 1986, and in revised form at the Annual Conference of the Renaissance Society of America, Stanford University, March 26-29, 1992.

We shall consider three texts that adopt this perspective. In all of them, the community's origins in antiquity (biblical, not classical) and its unchanging "constitution" are stressed, or at least strongly suggested. In the most detailed, Jewish communal government is associated explicitly with "democratic" government, while in the other two it is associated with republican alternatives to monarchic government. The immediate stimulus for this representation of the community was the prevalence in places where major ex-converso communities were es- tablished--in Venice, Amsterdam, and London--of what has been termed "classical republicanism" or "civic humanism." Briefly put, many of the elite inhabitants of these cities possessed a high degree of self-consciousness about their political institutions. The underlying idea of a free commonwealth, in which the entire body of citizens (however narrowly defined) acted to further the common good, was a widely accepted ideal, and the best means of achieving that ideal was a major topic of public discussion.' 1. In the 1960s and 1970s, a number of scholars in the English-speaking world took an interest in the early modem discourse of classical republicanism or civic humanism. See, in particular, Hans Baron, The Crisis of the Early Italian Renaissance: Civic Humanism and Republican Liberty in an Age of Classicism and Tyranny (1955; rev. ed., Princeton, 1966); A. B. Ferguson, The Articulate Citizen and the English Renaissance (Durham, N.C., 1965); W. J. Bouwsma, Venice and the Defense of Republican Liberty: Renaissance Values in the Age of the Counter Reformation (Berkeley, 1968); D. W. Hanson, From Kingdom to Commonwealth: The Development of Civic Consciousness in English Political Thought (Cambridge, Mass., 1970); J. G. A. Pocock, The Machiavellian Moment: Florentine Political Thought and the Atlantic Republican Tradition (Princeton, 1975); and Quentin Skinner, The Foundations of Modern Political Thought, 2 vols. (Cambridge, 1978). The role of classical political thinking among the Dutch was recognized and analyzed by a Dutch scholar: E. H. Kossman, Politieke theorie in het zeventiende-eeuwse Nederland (Amsterdam, 1960). Especially since the publication of Pocock's Machiavellian Moment and Skinner's Foundations of Modern Political Thought, a lively debate has emerged about the relationship between humanist rhetoric and Renaissance republicanism, between language and political life. (See, inter alia, Anthony Pagden, ed., The Languages of Political Theory in Early-Modern Europe [Cambridge, 1987] and James Tully, ed., Meaning and Context: Quentin Skinner and His Critics [Cambridge, 1988].) The discussion has also broadened to include political thinking outside Italy, England, and the early American republic. See, for example, the studies in H. Koenigsberger, ed., Republiken und Republikanismus in Europa der Friihen Neuzeit (Munich, 1988). A number of studies have focused on the Netherlands in particular. See E. H.

Several Jewish scholars in Renaissance Italy had interpreted the political organization of the ancient Israelites in light of neo-Aristotelian thinking (as Aquinas and other Christian scholars had done, and as Calvin would do).3 Among them, the most outstanding was Isaac Abravanel, a figure who was held in wide esteem by the Portuguese Jews. Abravanel was prompted to turn to the language of republicanism pri- marily by exegetical needs-above all, by the need to resolve the apparent contradiction between Deuteronomy 17:14-15 (which seemed to indicate that monarchy was divinely mandated for Israel) and I Samuel 8:6-7 (in which God and Samuel appeared to be angered by Israel's demand for a king). According to Abravanel, God's intention in the passage from Deuteronomy was that the Jews might set a king over them, not that they must do so. It was not a command but rather a reluctant concession to Israel: "The Lord did not choose that there should be a king in Israel, but rather a prophet and leader and judges like Moses and those who succeeded him, and this goes to show that a king is not necessary or beneficial for Israel."4 The ideal biblical regime was Mosaic and "republican," not Davidic and monarchic.5 van het stadhouderschap in de partijliteratur, 1650-1686," in Pieter De la Court in zijn tijd, ed.

Still important is the analysis of Leo Strauss, "On Abravanel's Philosophical Tendency and Political Teaching," which is careful to place Abravanel's "republicanism" in the context of his exegetical concerns and his overall theological outlook. Benzion Netanyahu's analysis in Don Isaac Abravanel, Statesman and Philosopher (Philadelphia, 1953), pp. 150-194, follows Strauss in many ways, but is more detailed and stresses Abravanel's conviction of the theologically based uniqueness of the Jews' political structures.

Indeed, in his commentary to Exodus 18:13-27, he drew a parallel between four Venetian governing institutions (the Great Council, the Senate, the Council of Forty, and the Council of Ten)6 and Moses' "rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens." Moses, of course, stood at the head of this hierarchy, so that the entire Mosaic system superficially resembled the ideal Renaissance "mixed government," which included rule by the One, the Few, and the Many. (Italian republicans commonly perceived in Venice the ultimate example of such rule, with its institutions of Doge, Senate, and Great Council). But if Abravanel borrowed conventional neo-Aristotelian rhetoric about the Venetian republic, it was strictly subordinated to his overall theological perspective. The reason Israel did not need a monarch lay in its uniqueness, its imperviousness to the laws that governed other nations, which were imperfect even at best: Israel possessed the divine laws of the Torah and enjoyed God's guidance. Despite Abravanel's use of standard hebraized Aristotelian terms (e.g., ha-kibbuts ha-medini), his Mosaic government was in fact a theocracy with a prophet-leader aided by a "republican" bureaucracy. For the purposes of this article, Abravanel's importance is twofold: first, in his suggesting a nonmonarchic ideal (albeit within a theocratic framework) as a legitimate alternative to the monarchic ideal so pervasive in Jewish deviating from Jewish traditions and influenced by Christian ideas. In this they are challenged by Gerald Blidstein, who seeks to show that antimonarchic views have solid roots in a rabbinic tradition according to which the Jews, who had God as their king, acted in rebellion against God when they urged Samuel to institute an earthly king. See Gerald Blidstein, "The Monarchic Imperative in Rabbinic Perspective," AJS Review 7-8 (1982-83): 15-39.

It should not come as a surprise that in the seventeenth century a far bolder conception of Jewish polity appeared among the Portuguese-Jewish emigres. These ex-conversos had not been conditioned in early life to the conventions of rabbinic thought. Their untutored ideas could sometimes be fatuous, but they could also be strikingly original. Their intellectual elite had been educated at Spanish and Portuguese universities, where they had been thoroughly familiarized with early modem scholastic thinking. As a result, they tended to integrate elements of Jewish tradition into a mental world built on different foundations, with unusual (and sometimes heretical) results. It was with such a background that some of them envisioned the autonomous Jewish community-a most medieval structure-as an embodiment of prevailing classical republican values. I have suggested that the emigres' position in Christian society prompted them to do so. The close association between national greatness and divine chosenness in Iberian (and, mutatis mutandis, Dutch and English) thinking made it difficult for them to accept a subordinate political status as Jews. And this mattered to them: They did not, like most European Jews in this period, feel generally indifferent to the attitudes of the gentile world. They were thus not inclined to content themselves with traditional notions of exile as punishment. They were more apt to assume a competitive posture (whether vis-a-vis Spaniard, Englishman, or Netherlander), and would be eager to defy the gentile image of the Jews as an abject people. But it was also true that the realities that supported this image were shifting in Western Europe. Jewish communities in Europe had always enjoyed autonomy, but now they were tasting libertas. The awareness among Portuguese Jews in Livorno, Amsterdam, and London (not, however, Venice) of the unusual degree of equality with Christians they enjoyed, particularly in commerce, may have encouraged them to view themselves in a class with other free citizenries, ancient and contemporary. In Amsterdam and London there was a further impetus to cultivate a political image of the Jewish community. Particularly in Protestant Europe, political and judicial argument drew not only from ancient Greece and Rome, but also from the biblical Hebrews.7 Moreover, in England and the Netherlands 7. On the use of biblical models in early modem political thinking, see S. B. Robinson, "The Biblical Hebrew State as an Example of the Ideal Government in the Writings of Political</page><page sequence="6">204 MIRIAM BODIAN the close association of political events, biblical allusions, and eschatological hopes may have encouraged contemporary Jews, the descendants of the Israelites, to view themselves as political actors in the unfolding drama.8 The apologetic value of depicting the community as a "republic" was considerable. The overall effect was one of normalization. The Jews appeared in a posture of active citizenship within a political structure, that is, as engaged in what post-Renaissance Europe, following the ancients, regarded as a central and universal human activity. The humiliations of exile at the political level were obscured, if not denied. This stance answered psychological needs as well as theological needs in the ongoing polemic with the Christian world. Let me now turn to three texts, all written within the span of two decades, which give expression to this idea. The most subtle and least explicit of these is a passage in Isaac Cardoso's apologetic work Las excelencias de los hebreos (1679), written while the author, a highly educated physician born in Portugal and trained in Castile, lived as a Jew in Verona. In a noteworthy passage in this work, Cardoso discussed Jewish communal life in terms that strongly evoked the early-modem civic ethos.9 "It elicits no little admiration," he wrote, "to see a people dispersed and scattered among the nations, and exiled for so many centuries, guarding its rites and ceremonies, and being like a republic apart, governing itself by the Law which God gave it, and by its sages who are its ministers and governors." The entire passage seems Thinkers of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries" (Hebrew), in Robinson, ed., Hinukh ben hemshekhiut u-petihut (Jerusalem, 1975), pp. 13-69.

Avis, "Moses and the Magistrate--A Study in the Rise of Protestant Legalism," Journal of Ecclesiastical History 26 (1975): 149-172. 8. On this aspect of English thinking, see Harold Fisch, Jerusalem and Albion: The Hebraic Theme in Seventeenth Century Literature (New York, 1964) and Joseph Anthony Mazzeo, "Cromwell as Davidic King," in Renaissance and Seventeenth-Century Studies (New York, 1964), pp. 183-208. Concerning the Dutch, the phenomenon is discussed in E. H. Kossman, In Praise of the Dutch Republic: Some Seventeenth-Century Attitudes (London, 1963), pp. 12-15, and Simon Schama, The Embarrassment of Riches: An Interpretation of Dutch Culture in the Golden Age (New York, 1987), pp. 93-125. Kossman and Schama differ considerably in their assessments of the national specificity of Dutch conceptions of chosenness (especially relative to the English); Kossman minimizes it, while Schama emphasizes it. 9.

It should be emphasized that Cardoso's primary intention in this passage was to refute the Christian claim that God had removed dominion from the Jews, in fulfillment of the prophecy that "the scepter shall not be taken from Judah nor the scribe from between his feet until Shiloh [Messiah] comes" (Gen. 49:10). That is, Cardoso's projection of the contemporary civic ethos onto Jewish communal rule was part of a polemical strategy aimed at proving that God had not removed dominion from the Jews. This required a bit of exegetical ingenuity on his part. No onewould have disputed his claim that the Jews "rule and govern themselves under their sages ... in conformity with the Law which God has commanded us." But how could the Jews be said to possess the scepter, when they had no king, no single ruler? To such an objection Cardoso replied that "the verse does not say 'crown,' but 'scepter,' and that signifies any form of rule." Any form of rule, such as, for example, republican. There is nothing new in Cardoso's assertion as a Jewish polemicist that the scepter of political authority had not departed from Judah. But as Y. H. Yerushalmi has pointed out, earlier commentators who had chosen to interpret "scepter" (shebet) in a political, postexilic sense had pointed to forms of supracommunal leadership, and not to internal communal government, as proof of this." Earlier commentators had, however, associated communal government with a parallel word in the same verse (mehokek),12 and Cardoso perhaps knowingly transferred it to the category defined by "scepter," with its more political connotation.13 The Jews no longer had a monarchy, but from a purely political point of view that might now be considered a virtue. 10. Cardoso's thorough acquaintance with the Renaissance myth of Venice is reflected in the dedication of his Philosophia libera to the doge and Senate of Venice; the dedication has been published in Yerushalmi, Spanish Court, pp. 219-220. 11. See Yerushalmi, Spanish Court, p. 383. And cf. A. Posnanski, Schiloh, Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der Messiaslehre (Leipzig, 1904); B.

See Berger, Jewish-Christian Debate, p. 22 (English trans., pp. 61-62). 13. In fact, Cardoso associates both terms with communal government, distinguishing between the form of community rule ("scepter") and those entrusted with it ("scribe").</page><page sequence="8">206 MIRIAM BODIAN In civic life they lacked nothing, for they did have a "republic," that is, the autonomous community. Cardoso did not directly confront the objection that the Jewish community, however self-governed it may have been, was ultimately subject to gentile rule. But his formulations suggested that this rule was rather benign and distant. The Jews in Babylonia, he stressed, had their own judges ("howbeit subject to the kings of Persia and Assyria"). Likewise, in the Second Temple period they had their own judges and sages (though "subject to the Persians or Romans"). Even under the conditions of exile and dispersion, Cardoso asserted, formal political subordination did not undermine the all-important fact of self-rule. Scattered "among the gentiles" as they were in his own time, the Jews "have their own governors and deputies as if they were a republic apart, possessing a concession and privilege from the princes who permit them to govern themselves according to their laws and customs." Their status was thus depicted not as forced upon them, but as freely negotiated. Whether or not Cardoso actually meant to suggest an analogy between the Jewish community and the republican states of Italy, there can be little doubt that what prompted or at least permitted his view was an acquaintance with a political milieu dominated by the republican ideal. The paradigm of the Re- naissance republic governed by ancient laws and by elected representatives of the citizenry did in fact lend itself to comparison with the Jewish community, with its statutes and elected parnassim, more than monarchy, with its pomp and mystique. Moreover, Jewish autonomous government might now more convincingly be included under the term "scepter," for in a time when civil authority and jurisdiction were increasingly the prerogative of the central power, communal autonomy had come to imply a degree of sovereignty. But herein lay the problem inherent in this line of thinking. By the second half of the seventeenth century, those Italian city-states which could claim to be free were in precipitous decline. The great states of Europe (with the important exception of the Netherlands) were states with strong centralized governments, and these governments were busy appropriating the liberties and privileges enjoyed by corporative bodies like the Jewish communities. Paradoxically, Cardoso's appreciative description of the Jews as a "republic apart" reveals a certain lack of political prescience. His language bears an uncanny resemblance to the language used to describe the Jewish community in several governmental documents drawn up in Venice earlier in the century--except that in these cases the same language was</page><page sequence="9">BIBLICAL HEBREWS AND THE RHETORIC OF REPUBLICANISM 207 applied in a sharply negative sense. The documents concerned condemned the Jewish community for arrogating to itself exclusive jurisdiction over the Jews, thus making itself a "republic apart."14 The logic of such criticism would eventually be used to dismantle the Jewish community as Cardoso knew it. Another expression of Jewish civic pride appears in the preamble to the statutes of the London Portuguese-Jewish community (1664).'5 Although the passage predates Cardoso's, its language is more explicitly the language of contemporary political discourse. "Experience has shown," it opens, "that it is a necessary thing in all republics and nations to have statutes wherewith to be governed." This somewhat pompous commonplace served immediately to place the Jewish community within a universal political context. The preamble then proceeds to give two justifications for the particular form the community's government took. First, oddly enough, was the argu- ment that "all follow the example of our nation's government." Of course such a statement was sheer hyperbole, but it reflected the acute awareness on the part of the drafters that the Protestant world sometimes looked to the Hebrew Bible for legal and political precedent. This allowed them to suggest that while the English and Dutch (and occasionally the Venetians and Florentines) found biblical precedents for their own political histories, it was the Jewish community that had the most direct roots in Hebrew government. The subterranean message was that some of the great states of Europe were patterned after biblical forms which were still vital and integral to Jewish society. There was a polemical aspect to this message. It contradicted the Protestant's assumption that "Hebrew government" belonged to a distant past when the Jews were still God's chosen people. It laid claim to an unbroken tradition of Hebrew government which continued to be manifested in organized Jewish communal life. 14. In a memorandum drawn up in 1631 for the Venetian authorities, the Jewish community of Venice was attacked for assuming exclusive jurisdiction over the Jews, thus making itself "una Repubblica da ogn'altro Dominio separata," an intolerable situation. See Benjamin Ravid, "'A Republic Separate from All Other Government': Jewish Autonomy in Venice in the Seventeenth Century" (Hebrew), in Hagut u-maaseh: sefer zikaron le-Shimon Ravidovits, ed. Grinboim and Ivri (Tel Aviv, 1983), p. 56 and Appendix, Document 6; for other examples, see pp. 59, 61. 15. The preamble has been published (along with the statutes) in M. Bodian, "The Escamot of the Spanish-Portuguese Jewish Community of London, 1664," Michael 9 (1985): 16.</page><page sequence="10">208 MIRIAM BODIAN The second argument given was that of Jewish precedent. The preamble noted that "in all the communities of Israel, statutes (escamot) are instituted in order to govern." A pattern of Jewish government has been established and, "seeing that it is our obligation to imitate our ancestors," the London community has obediently drawn from "those [statutes] observed in K.K. Talmud Torah of the city of Amsterdam, which has adopted those of Venice." The passage as a whole appears quite consistent with the conservative "republican" spirit of Restoration England at the time it was written. While it sought to invest the Jewish community with the political attributes of Christian commonwealths, it avoided association with specific political forms. The term "republic" as used by the drafters of the statutes bears only the general meaning of government based on law and custom.'6 This is not surprising. The passage was drafted in 1664, four years after the Restoration. In the previous years of turmoil, English political thought--overwhelmingly "republican" by one definition or another-had thrived. Now, with parliamentary rule firmly ensconced in what was widely regarded as a "mixed monarchy," classical republican rhetoric of a moderate sort had come to prevail."7 The originality of the London community's preamble lies in its appropri- ation of the vocabulary of contemporary political discourse. However vague and banal that language was, it was surely effective in dispelling an image of the Jews as a helpless, homeless people rejected by God. The preamble also served this purpose by pointing out the community's pedigree: its statutes were based on those of the Amsterdam community, which in turn were based on those of the Venetian community (i.e., the Venetian "Ponentine" community, or community of Portuguese Jews), as part of a chain of political tradition, it was suggested, that reached back to Roman times. It may be that in the eyes of the Portuguese Jews, the Jewish community of Venice, one of the major centers of Jewish life in its own right, came to be associated with the persistent and widely disseminated myth of the serenissima repubblica. The main features of this myth, in its many variations, 16. It should be noted that "republic" bears a number of meanings in the seventeenth century, and should be understood according to context. It may be used to designate a nonmonarchic regime, but it is frequently used in the wider sense of "commonwealth" and in this sense can be found applied to Catholic France or Spain. In some instances it refers to a social rather than a political entity, as when Isaac Orobio de Castro speaks of the Jews as a "republica esparsida por todo el mundo, mas castigada con la privacion del antigo dominio" (Prevenciones divinas contra la vana Idolatria de las gentes, MS Ets Haim 48D6, fol. 63v). 17. See Hanson, From Kingdom to Commonwealth.</page><page sequence="11">BIBLICAL HEBREWS AND THE RHETORIC OF REPUBLICANISM 209 were (a) that Venice's political order had existed, stable and unchanged, from ancient times, and (b) that Venice's consistent resistance to violent change was the result of its mixed and balanced constitution." It is possible that the Jews of London, newly organized as a community and drawing up their constitution, sought to associate themselves with the aura of permanence and longevity evoked by the very mention of Venice. But if they were obligated, as they stated, "to imitate our ancestors," it was not the Venetians--nor the Athenians or Spartans-they sought to imitate, but the Jewish equivalents of these citizenries, as it were: the denizens of Jewish communities from ancient times to the present. Such a notion lent weight and distinction to what was in fact a tiny (about 225 persons) and recently organized community of relative newcomers to Judaism. The most elaborate effort to present the Jewish community in a republican guise is Daniel Levi de Barrios's long introduction to his Triumpho del govierno popular'9 De Barrios's introductory essay to this work is not, like the other two texts, a vague, generalized presentation of the theme under discussion, but a highly embellished production in which the author portrayed Jewish history over the ages as a political history, and a praiseworthy one in classical and contemporary terms (as he understood them). The work as a whole bears a certain resemblance to the panegyric literature on Venice and other Italian city-states, a literature with which De Barrios was probably familiar. This is not to imply that De Barrios's Triumpho del govierno popular belongs to the genre of laudatio literature. His work is only a 18.

Nevertheless, De Barrios's general aim of describing the history of the community's institutions and showing their excellence does hark back to the laudatio genre. While De Barrios's political thinking provided a crucial backdrop for his historical scheme, it should not be taken for more than it is. De Barrios did not have a profound interest in political thought and institutions. He was primarily a poet, and too much an aesthete, too much the tormented soul to be deeply concerned about public affairs. On the basis of the sources he cites, it seems evident that he had no more than a superficial acquaintance with the great works of political philosophy, whether ancient or early modem. His taste in reading outside the field of belles-lettres, as well as his friendships, reveal an attraction to historical chronicles and geography (in which he himself dabbled).20 It is true that he was familiar (directly or indirectly) with major classical authors, Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Seneca, Tacitus, and others. But in his Triumpho del govierno popular he also cited patristic literature, the Bible, and rabbinic works, particularly Midrash. And he drew from the classics of the Portuguese diaspora-Immanuel Aboab's Nomologia, Isaac Athias's Tesoro de preceptos, the works of Menasseh ben Israel, and Isaac Cardoso's Excelencias de los hebreos. A prominent place among his sources was also occupied by works of a historical or semihistorical character. Among Jewish authors, he drew from Josephus, the Antiquitates of Pseudo-Philo, Sefer ha-yashar, Solomon Ibn Verga's Shebet Yehudah, and David Gans's Zemah David. And he drew abundantly from early modem Dutch, Spanish, and ex-converso works in the realm of history and geography-works by such figures as the Dutch geographer Jan Blaeu, the Dominican historian Juan de la Puente, the Franciscan historian Juan de Pineda, and the ex-converso Toma's de Pinedo. De Barrios's eclectic and belletristic inclinations are obvious in his "political history" of the Jews, which is unsystematic and often vague. There are glaring incongruities. Even the sincerity of De Barrios's opinions may be 20.

A most complex figure, De Barrios was something of a misfit in the very community whose virtues he extolled. He had encountered the disapproval of the communal leadership on several occasions, and his attitude to it was doubtless complex and ambivalent.21 Moreover, the work as a whole, like other civic panegyrics, was produced at least in part to curry favor with communal leaders, whose patronage De Barrios needed badly.22 An indication of this is the fact that the book was dedicated to the parnassim, or elders, of the community, who were mentioned collectively in flattering conceits.23 (It is worth noting that De Barrios had earlier composed a fawning 24-page rhymed history of Florence entitled Historia y descripcion de la celebre y ducal Ciudad de Florencia [1674], a work largely devoted to praising the very Medicis who had dealt the final death blow to republican Florence, and dedicated to the Medici grand duke of Tuscany.)24 Yet all of this does not detract from the work's significance. Whatever his true opinions, De Barrios had reason to believe that the communal leaders would welcome a work which depicted the Jews as a political people and the Portuguese-Jewish community of Amsterdam as a "republic"--indeed, as a republic of a democratic sort. Had they disapproved strongly of the work, they would not have hesitated to censor it or prohibit its circulation. Let us look at the work itself. De Barrios opened it, after some introductory verses, with the statement that "the great majority of commonwealths (Polit- icas Gentes) belong to three major categories." These were, first, "monarchy, or singular, such as that of Moses, Saul, David, and Solomon"; second, "aristocracy, like that of Joshua, the Judges, and the Maccabees"; and third, "democracy, or popular government, such as that of the Israelites in Egypt, in Babylonia, and in all those places where they have been dispersed with the 21.

It is known that De Barrios received financial aid from the parnassim (see W. Chr.

The author's classification according to these pure types is rather deceptive, as we shall see, and he may have intended to point, in each case, to the predominant element in an otherwise "mixed" government. What is important in this passage--and it is consistent with the rest of the text-is the sharp distinction between Jewish government in the periods of independence (monarchic, aristocratic) and Jewish government in exile (democratic). De Barrios wished to describe a continuous tradition of government, but he was apparently too attached to conventional notions of Jewish history, which stressed the radical break that accompanied exile, to do so. The relationship between the opening passage cited above and the rest of the essay is somewhat problematic. Partly this is due to the extremely fluid character of political terminology in the seventeenth century, which makes it difficult to know what De Barrios meant when he used terms like "republic" and "popular government." Partly it is due to the imbalance in his treatment of the three types of regimes he set out to describe. He showed a genuine interest in only two regimes: first, the Mosaic regime, his conception of which was similar to that of Abravanel-in fact, a mixed government with a monarchic element; and second, the autonomous Jewish community in exile, to which De Barrios attributed distinctly "democratic" traits. He dismissed the "aristocratic" period of Jewish government in a single sentence, characterizing it negatively as having neither unity nor stability.26 Let us consider the two regimes which actually occupied De Barrios. In his discussion of monarchy, the author disposed of the list of monarchs he mentioned at the outset, namely Moses, Saul, David, and Solomon, and presented a new series of monarchs-figures who in his view represented the sole examples of "righteous monarchy" in history. (Saul, David, and Solomon, while examples of monarchs, evidently did not fit the bill, for reasons which can easily be conjectured.) Two of the three "righteous monarchs" actually predated the Hebrews, namely, Hanoch and Yoqtan; the third was Moses. De Barrios's choice of the two pre-Mosaic monarchs is at first glance puzzling, especially since he devoted the briefest possible discussion to them 25. TGP, p. 2. 26. Ibid., p. 22.</page><page sequence="15">BIBLICAL HEBREWS AND THE RHETORIC OF REPUBLICANISM 213 at this point.27 (We shall see further on his reasons for including Yoqtan.) Yet he did mention his sources, and if we analyze the account of Hanoch's reign as prophet-king in Sefer ha-yashar,28 and the account of Yoqtan's heroic resistance to tyranny in the Antiquitates of Pseudo-Philo,29 we find that these figures do resemble the ideal monarch as De Barrios conceived him. The righteous monarch, he wrote, must reign "with the fear of God, recognizing as the [true] Sovereign Monarch the Infinite Archetype."30 The Mosaic monarchy was described by De Barrios in greater detail, being "more perfect than its two antecedents, those of Hanoch and Yoqtan,"3' and representing, of course, a defining moment in Jewish history. What Moses desired, wrote De Barrios, rather than a pure monarchy, was "a government of collaborating parts" (govierno divisamente reciproco),32 with an aristocratic and a popular element. De Barrios's description of the Mosaic regime,33 it may be noted, is preceded by an endorsement of Abravanel's criticism of monarchy, and De Barrios's conception certainly resembles Abravanel's in several respects. The very choice of the Mosaic regime as the archetype of good government may reflect Abravanel's influence. Of course Abravanel did not depict Moses as a monarch; on the contrary, he presented him as evidence that a king was unnecessary for the Jews. But the issue was largely semantic, and indeed Abravanel himself referred to Moses in one passage as "the first king who reigned over Israel."34 Both Abravanel and De Barrios viewed the Mosaic regime as a "mixed republic" combining rule of the One (the prophet-ruler Moses), the Few, and the Many. The Few, De Barrios argued (following Abravanel),35 were the seventy elders appointed after God saw that monarchy alone was "too burdensome even for Moses." God acted to lighten the burden, "adding an aristocracy in 27. Ibid., p. 8. 28. Sepher hajaschar, Das Helderibuch, ed. Lazarus Goldschmidt (Berlin, 1923), pp. 8-14. 29.

With regard to the rule of the Many, however, De Barrios departed significantly from Abravanel. Abravanel viewed as the democratic element the Lower Courts of twenty-three judges (a rabbinic innovation), chosen, in his opinion, by the people. But these were minor authorities, so that the participation of the "people" was in fact quite a limited one. De Barrios, in contrast, argued (on the basis of the episode concerning popular prophecy in Numbers 11:25-29) that Moses at least wished for a purely democratic regime, one in which everyone would be a prophet. Concluded De Barrios, Moses governed in such a way that when he was most exalted by the eternal Majesty, with the granting of monarchic and aristocratic powers, he humbly desired that all should be prophets [Num. 11:29], so that all should be equal; and that all being equal, there would be no occasion to envy the government either of an individual or of the elect few.36 De Barrios thus flirted with a political radicalism which was not present in either Abravanel or the other two texts we have considered. Indeed, he did so to the point of self-contradiction, suggesting that the popular element "always elects its ruler." (He had just stated that it was God who granted Moses monarchic powers.) Continuing in this vein, he concluded that "this [election by the people] is what Moses desired, for (as Pliny stated), 'He who leads and rules over all, should be elected by all.' " The notion of democratic government suggested (despite inconsistencies) in these passages stands in contrast to the humanist conception. It assumed universal---or at least very broad-participation: populus included vulgus. This was the best form of political organization according to De Barrios because such a system ensured that the common good was given the highest priority, eliminating the misuse of power for personal gain which was the chief danger of government by the few. It is worth noting that De Barrios had settled in Amsterdam by 1662,37 that is, at the midpoint of the stadholderless regime dominated by Johan de Witt. This was a period of deep political conflict and remarkable ideolog- ical ferment in the Netherlands. Of the three major political currents that 36. TGP, pp. 5-7. 37. See Pieterse, Daniel Levi de Barrios, p. 17.</page><page sequence="17">BIBLICAL HEBREWS AND THE RHETORIC OF REPUBLICANISM 215 emerged--monarchists who supported the House of Orange, republicans who opposed monarchy but supported Orangist rule of some kind, and radical anti-Orangist republicans who repudiated any form of rule by one person--De Barrios was evidently persuaded in some way by the latter.38 By leaning in this direction (although he was far from consistent), he was by no means following public opinion in the Dutch republic. Most Netherlanders who thought about such matters took their own system of government to be ideal, and were inclined to see it as a monarchia aristocratico-democratica.39 De Barrios was perhaps toying with radical notions of the kind developed by the De la Court brothers. His anti-monarchism, however, was utterly conventional. Monarchy, he argued, was a system of government which had little chance of not degener- ating into tyranny, "for rare is the monarch who puts the good of his subjects before his own, and rare are the subjects who serve God more than the king."40 It may be recalled that history had witnessed only three "righteous monarchs." Democratic government, as De Barrios stated at the opening of his essay, was the regime of the Jews throughout their periods of exile. This was the case even in pre-Mosaic Egyptian exile, so that democracy was the most ancient and long-lived mode of government Jews had practiced.41 As evidence of the antiquity of this type of rule, De Barrios cited the "dynasty of shepherds," by which he was apparently referring to a race of "king-shepherds" whom Josephus mentioned as leaders of the Israelites in Egypt.42 (De Barrios did 38.

Kossman, "Dutch Republicanism," p. 472. 40. TGP, p. 4. In another passage, too, he expressed his general conviction that the people could best govern themselves, since government was for their sake: "Aristotle and Plato have said, 'The people are not made for the sake of the ruler, but the ruler for the sake of the people.' From this I conclude that popular rule is better than that of the nobility and the king" (TGP, p. 7). 41. Ibid., pp. 23-24. 42. De Barrios cited as his source a work by the Franciscan scholar Juan de Pineda, La Monarquia eclesiastia, y Historia universal del Mundo desde su creaci6n (Salamanca, 1588). I have not seen this work. However, it would appear that Pineda was drawing from the passage in Contra Apionem in which Josephus cited the Egyptian chronicler Manetho, who identified the Jews with the "king-shepherds" expelled from Egypt (Loeb Classical Library ed., I, pp. 190-201).</page><page sequence="18">216 MIRIAM BODIAN not explain how this regime was democratic.) The second democratic regime was that of the Jews in their various congregations or settlements during the Babylonian exile.43 In the passage dealing with this period, De Barrios offered his first hint as to what constituted the salient feature of democracy in Jewish communal government, as he saw it. He referred to a passage from Strabo (cited in Josephus) concerning the Jews of Alexandria, stating that they had their own streets where they lived under their own laws and rulers, "with absolute power as if they were a republic unto themselves."44 De Barrios struck a similar note in his discussion of the third democratic period, extending from the destruction of the Second Temple to his own time-the period of the "Sustentadores o Parnasim."45 De Barrios referred to "all the Israelites who were dispersed among the nations" as "governing themselves with the Mosaic Law."46 These two statements strongly suggest that De Barrios associated democracy; first, with liberty in its ancient sense, i.e., collective freedom from foreign interference or tyrannical rule, and, second, with rule by one's own laws and customs. These two themes-political independence (that is, communal autonomy) and self-government by the Law of Moses-are reiterated throughout De Barrios's Triumpho del govierno popular In the opuscule "Historia universal judayca," the author surveyed the condition of Jews throughout the world, stressing their autonomy. He wrote, for example, that "in Poland, Prussia, and Lithuania they have jurisdiction in their own criminal and civil matters, and have great and famous universities [!] and academies."47 Perhaps borrowing from Cardoso, but elaborating further, he interpreted the scepter that shall not depart from Judah as the "rod and staff of justice or government"48 and concluded: "and this scepter was preserved under the rule of the masters (Sefiores) who composed the Talmud; and even today those who govern the Jews of Poland are called princes and masters (Principes y Seniores) of the Four Lands. And in all the regions where congregations are to be found, the Hebrews have rulers of their own nation and Law." The word "scribe" 43. TGP, pp. 28-33. 44.

More specifically, he continued, "the rabbinic authority, in order to guard the Law, institutes those statutes (fueros) which we call 'fences of the Sages.' "49 De Barrios also elaborated on the notion of the antiquity, immutability, and eternity of the Law of Moses (perhaps inspired by Cardoso), comparing a united Jewish people with an unstable, fragmented gentile world. While the Chaldaeans, Phoenicians, Egyptians, Persians, Medians, Greeks, and Romans, with their monarchies and laws, have perished, "the Law of Moses persists among the people who observe it."'" And while the Christian sects have proliferated, each with its different rites-"Papists," Socinians, Lutherans, Quakers, Calvinists, "and many other sects"-only Mosaic Law retains its original, uncorrupted form."5 The antiquity, continuity, and stability of government so sought after by the gentile nations were in fact, De Barrios implied, achieved only by the Jews. Such thinking is far from radical republicanism. And in fact, De Barrios's use of the terms "democracy" and govierno popular in reference to the Jewish community is highly misleading. What he seems to have meant is government brought into being by the people, a government based on the sovereignty of the people. But such a notion could be (and had been) mobilized by political thinkers to support various types of government, including absolute monarchy. De Barrios, then, used the terms "democracy" and "popular government" primarily to signify the freedom of the autonomous Jewish community to govern itself. As far as the Amsterdam community was concerned, this liberty had been achieved at great effort (escape from Spanish tyranny through flight) and with the consent of the government of the Netherlands (which also had its origins in resistance to Spanish tyranny). In choosing to live by the Law of Moses, the Portuguese Jews of Amsterdam were repeating, so to speak, the unanimous decision of the Israelites at Mount Sinai. That is, the ancient liberty of the Jews had been denied them in Spain and Portugal by a coercive, persecutory regime; but it had been restored by common agreement among 49. Ibid., pp. 642-643. The theme recurs in fanciful fashion elsewhere: "El Governador, y Magistrado es una Ley que habla: y la Ley es un Hombre que tiene por huessos los 248 Preceptos Afirmativos: y por nervios y venas sus 365 Preceptos Negativos" (p. 395). 50.

This was the "triumph of popular government."52 In the last part of his introductory essay, De Barrios pulled together a number of strings. The point at which they met was a geographical one: the city of Amsterdam. Here, it may be appropriate to point out the full title of the work: Triumpho del govierno popular, y de la Antiguedad Holandesa. The author showed by means of letter symbolism that the city of Amsterdam was hinted at in the first word of Scripture (na,'ni) when read in reverse. "Tey" ('n) signified the body of water known as the IJ (Ye), onto which Amsterdam faced. (With the definite article, it became " 't IJ.") The letter "V", pronounced in reverse as a Spaniard would tend to pronounce it, became "Nes"--the name of a very old street in Amsterdam, which De Barrios believed to have been the original name of the town itself. The letters " la", pronounced in reverse, became "Ereb," that is, the region of the Arebacas (Arevacos, the largest of the Celtiberian tribes), from which region the descendants of Eber had come to Holland, according to De Barrios.53 That the descendants of Eber had come from Spain and inhabited the region of Holland was derived from the verse in Scripture which describes the dwelling-place of the descendants of Yoqtan, son of Eber and prince of the descendants of Shem: "And their dwelling was 52. That this is what De Barrios meant by the phrase triumpho del govierno popular is revealed most explicitly in a passage describing the early days of the Amsterdam community, in which he alluded to the return to Jewish tradition as the triumpho de la Mosayca Ley (TGP, p. 407). De Barrios was able to depict the community as he did because he did not view its government from the point of view of institutional structure and dynamics, as one would expect if he were actually interested in political theory. It was within a larger historical and theoretical framework that he regarded the Amsterdam community; and this permitted him to view the complex process by which the community came into being as a rather simple act of collective will. Insofar as De Barrios did dwell on the structure of the community and its institutions-and he did so only very briefly--he presented a scheme which appears to have drawn from the classical republican notion of mixed government, and which seems designed to obscure the overwhelming subordination of all other communal institutions in the Amsterdam community to the Mahamad. "The popular Jewish government of Amsterdam," he wrote, "is divided into four types of government: political, rabbinic, charitable, and academic." He surveyed each of these separately. While he noted that the political body, the Mahamad, had authority over the rabbinic body (the bet din) "regarding the synagogue and in financial matters," the overall impression he gave was one of a community in which power was fragmented and balanced far more than was actually the case.

De Barrios cited sources suggesting that kedem referred to Spain or some part of it, and that "Mesha" referred to the river Maas in the Netherlands-Mosa in Latin.54 The Dutch people, then, descendants of Yoqtan, were Semites with roots in Spain (and not, as Dutch myth-making would have it, descendants of the ancient Batavians of Roman times).55 And now, to return to Yoqtan, the second righteous monarch mentioned by De Barrios. At this point we should consider more closely the story which served as his source, found in the Antiquitates of Pseudo-Philo. According to this story, Yoqtan intervened heroically to rescue Abram and other dissenters who refused to cooperate in the plan to build the Tower of Babel. Abram was ultimately thrown into the brick kiln, but he was saved by a miracle, and it was the evil Nimrod and Fenech, and their followers, who suffered death by fire.56 History, to De Barrios and many of his contemporaries, unfolded by replication. Nimrod was associated with tyranny, tyranny with imperial Spain, the Spanish with Catholic idolatry and the Inquisition, the Inquisition with fire. The Dutch, in contrast, were linked spiritually with the Jews. Yoqtan's wife, according to De Barrios, was the legendary Moso mentioned by Alexander Polyhistor, and this "Legisladora" had expounded the seven Noachide Laws to the sons of Eber (the father of Yoqtan).57 The nonidolatrous Noachide beliefs of the sons of Eber, it was suggested, could be found in the Calvinist doctrines of their seventeenth-century counterparts. It was the strength of these beliefs that stirred the descendants of Yoqtan in the Spanish Netherlands to rise up and overthrow an idolatrous, tyrannical monarch; and afterwards, it was they who offered the sons of Abraham a refuge from the flames of the autos-de-fe. 54. Ibid., pp. 46-47. 55. On the classical humanist roots of the Batavian myth, see I.

Alexander Polyhistor relates only that a woman named Moso gave the Law to the Jews (M. Stem, Greek and Latin Authors, I, p. 163). Suidas, also cited by De Barrios, gives the same information (Suidae Lexicon, ed. Ada Adler, vol. 1, p. 104 1. 34). In addition, De Barrios cited Tomais de Pinedo's commentary on Stephen of Byzantium as a source. I have not seen this.</page><page sequence="22">220 MIRIAM BODIAN Just as Eber was related phonetically to Hebrew (and to Iberia),58 so there was a spiritual kinship between their descendants. "And [the descendants] of Yoqtan, because they observed the statutes of Noah, crushed [the descendants] of Nimrod; they came from the mountain of Sefar [suggesting "Sefarad"] to the banks of the Mosa River. In the same way, the Hebrews, because they observe the Mosaic precepts and have fled the Nimrod of the Spanish Inquisition, have come to Holland."59 The same theme is elaborated further on: The Babylonians burned to death those who did not worship the statue they raised to King Nebuchadnezzar. In the same way the Inquisitors burn to death those who do not worship images. But the Estates of the United Provinces show favor to them [who do not worship images], just as the prince Yoqtan did to the patriarch Abraham and his companions.60 Thus, in his baroque fashion, De Barrios drew a correspondence between the Dutch people and the Portuguese Jews in Amsterdam, a correspondence with many facets, of which republican government was but one. Like con- temporary Netherlanders, De Barrios regarded republican government as be- longing to a wider constellation of desirable things: political independence, self-government by the body of citizens, freedom of conscience,61 and true monotheism. Tyranny was associated with a contrary constellation: subjuga- tion to foreign powers, internal repression, religious persecution, and idolatry. In proposing an ancient historical link between the Portuguese Jews and the Dutch people, De Barrios was no doubt encouraged by the fact that Dutch Calvinists were fond of identifying themselves with the biblical Israelites. But De Barrios naturally rejected the notion that the Dutch were the true Israel. In his historical scheme, the Jews were still the chosen people, and provided the perfect pattern, in government as in other matters. Nevertheless, their destiny was linked historically and spiritually to that of the sons of Eber. The attempt by certain Portuguese Jews in the seventeenth century to imbue Jewish communal life with the political ethos of republican Europe should by no means be taken to reflect a process parallel to that taking place in Western European societies, in which theoretical discussion was provoked by fundamental political conflicts and changes. The passages we have cited had an 58. TGP, pp. 47-48. 59. Ibid., p. 398. 60. Ibid., p. 421. 61.

But they reveal quite clearly that republican rhetoric resonated strongly for some, perhaps many, Portuguese Jews. The wishful identification of these Jews with republican government may well have been an early sign of what was to become European Jewry's most deep-seated political instinct after emancipation: alignment with parties and governments that not only reiterated some of the themes of classical repub- licanism, but acted on them to protect political, civil, and religious liberties. The Portuguese Jews had experienced extreme repression under an absolutist regime; those who emigrated to Italy, the Netherlands, and England, while not generally advocates of individual freedom of conscience, were well prepared to appreciate the freedoms they there enjoyed collectively. These texts, then, offer an example well before the Enlightenment of Jews whose acquaintance with European republican values made them aware of a potential alternative to typical Jewish conditions of exile. They were able to envision the Jew as a citizen within a republic. With their unusually developed knowledge of ancient and early modem political literature, they were remarkably poised to appreciate, in a way other Jews would do only much later, the significance of republican rhetoric and emerging political patterns in their new environments. They did not, however, fully grasp the implications for the future of Jewish communal life. Ironically, the forces that stimulated a "civic" view of the autonomous community were ultimately to bring about the decline and elimination of communal autonomy. A modem state in which all citizens theoretically shared common liberties and responsibilities could not tolerate a group with its own separate laws, courts, police powers, and privileges. On the other hand, such emerging states did offer Jews the prospect of an escape from the conditions of subjugation and humiliation associated with Jewish exile in the medieval period. However strongly the authors of these texts may have been influenced by the Jews' still corporative relationship to the state, their sympathetic interest in republican notions reveals an early if nebulous grasp of the emancipatory potential such notions possessed.
