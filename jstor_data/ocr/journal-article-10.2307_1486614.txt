<plain_text><page sequence="1">Simcha Fishbane. The Method and Meaning of the Mishnah Berurah. Hobo- ken, N.J.: Ktav, 1991. 183 pp. Few halakhic works of recent times have attained the degree of acceptance and prestige enjoyed by the Mishnah Berurah of R. Israel Meir Hakohen Kagan (d. 1933). This compendium exerts a profound influence upon the ritual life of the observant Jew; as such, it is a significant document of Jewish intellectual history, and a thorough analysis of its literary structure and legal methodology is long overdue. In the present volume, Simcha Fishbane has taken a valuable first step in this direction. I say "valuable" because Fishbane correctly emphasizes the importance of literary genre in the understanding of Kagan's accomplishment. Like the works of the great aharonim, the Mishnah Berurah is cast as a commentary to R. Joseph Karo's Shulhan Arukh, Orahz Hayim. Kagan thus "testifies to [his] desire to be identified with the Weltanschauung of the authoritative commentators on the Shulhan Arukh in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries" (p. 156). Put differently, the form of this work is no less indicative of its author's personal philosophy than is its content. The stylistic contrast between the Mishnah Berurah and other similar works, such as R. Shalom Mordekhai Schwadron's Da 'at Torah (which is not a running commentary on all essential points of law) and R. Yehiel Michael Epstein's Arukh Ha-Shulhan (which imitates the style of the Mishneh Torah and the Tur rather than that of the aharonim), is therefore of great significance. "His employment of the</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 107 literary genre of the Aharonim makes the Mishnah Berurah part of a mature, authoritative legal system that in the mind of its adherents stretches back over a thousand years" (p. 156). In his concentration upon genre, Fishbane dissects this aharonic work with those tools of form-criticism that have been utilized in the study of classical rabbinic texts. Therein lies his hiddush, his major innovation and scholarly contribution. I say "first step" because, despite Fishbane's detailed analysis of the text of the Mishnah Berurah, so much remains to be done. This comment stems in part from the limited circumference of his study, which covers but six of the 697 chapters in Kagan's commentary. Although Fishbane claims (p. 3) that these sections (chaps. 243-247 and 252, dealing with Jewish-Gentile relations touching upon the laws of Shabbat) are representative of the entire work, he does not demonstrate the accuracy of his assertion. Clearly, his study should be expanded, both in quantity and in the variety of halakhic subject matter, so as to establish that his findings are anything but tentative. More data, too, would be helpful in clarifying those conclusions which in their present form are somewhat diffuse. For example, Fishbane wants us to see Kagan as more than a summarizer of the aharonim. He was, after all, a man of musar, the author of such ethical-religious treatises as Hafez IHayim and Nidh.ei Yisrael; it is no surprise, then, that his "ethical sensibility continually stands behind his discussion and, indeed, frequently comes to the surface" (p. 5). At the same time we are told (p. 157) that musar and other extralegal materials are employed in only three of the 160 subparagraphs analyzed in this book. In none of these cases, it should be added, does musar lead Kagan to deviate from the accepted halakhah. Another indication of the posek's worldview, says Fishbane, is his tendency to rule stringently on "contemporary issues" which raise his "halakhic anxieties" (p. 167), in keeping with his desire "to maintain and regulate the boundaries between his milieu and secular Jewish society" (p. 163). Yet in the very paragraph which contains this last statement, we read that Kagan is unwilling "to rule leniently on a contemporary issue when there are disputing opinions." The question thus arises: when Kagan rules stringently, does he do so because the issue is a contemporary one (assuming it is more "contemporary" for him than it was for the aharonim, an assumption whose proof requires historical and sociological details which Fishbane never provides) and he wishes to erect a fence against incursions from the nonobservant Jewish world? Or does he do so because his legal sources, aharonic and earlier (see the discussion on sec. 246, subpars.</page><page sequence="3">108 BOOK REVIEWS 31 ff.), are in dispute, and as a matter of legal philosophy he favors stringency as the safest means to cover all halakhic bases (to be yozei kol ha-de'ot)? The evidence is mixed, inasmuch as the matters identified here as "contemporary" already bear stringent rulings by some of Kagan's predecessors. A wider study might help untangle the confusion between Kagan as man of musar and Kagan as the faithful redactor of aharonic halakhic thought. Such a wider study ought to proceed on two fronts, the diachronic and the synchronic. Kagan's conclusions first should be placed within the ongoing context of the work of the aharonim. To what extent are his rulings reflections or logical extensions of decisions and tendencies in their writings? To what extent does he deviate from them, break new ground, chart an independent halakhic course? Fishbane makes a stab at this kind of diachronic analysis, but the pre-Mishnah Berurah state of Eastern European halakhah needs a more detailed and explicit treatment than is provided by this work, which focuses almost exclusively upon the words of the Mishnah Berurah itself. Second, the researcher should compare Kagan's rulings in the Mishnah Berurah against those of his contemporaries. Is he significantly or more frequently stringent than, say, Epstein in the Arukh Ha-Shtdlhan? Is his work more indicative of "contemporary concerns," and if so, does his response to those concerns differ substantially? In this way, we can best determine the precise contribution of R. Israel Meir Hakohen Kagan to Jewish legal thought. In the meantime, Fishbane has earned the appreciation of all who work in the field. That more can and ought to be done should not obscure the important contribution he has made to the state of research.
