<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE POLITICS OF INTERPRETATION: TEL HAI IN ISRAEL'S COLLECTIVE MEMORY by YAEL ZERUBAVEL Introduction In 1920, a brief but fatal battle between Arabs and Jews took place at the Jewish settlement of Tel Hai in the northern Galilee. The defense of Tel Hai soon became a landmark in the history of Israeli society. The story of Tel Hai was regarded as a major symbolic text of the pioneering ethos and an important step toward the development of a new national Hebrew culture. Highlighting the theme of collective death and rebirth, Tel Hai offered a modern, secular text that sanctified the new nation and dramatized the emergence of a new type of Jew. For the Jewish pioneers in Palestine, Tel Hai embodied the ideals of settlement and defense, providing a concrete example of their resolute determination to hold on to new settlements at all costs. The present study examines the role of Tel Hai as a national myth, name- I would like to thank Eviatar Zerubavel, Barry Schwartz, Mike Aronoff, Dan Ben-Amos, Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett Michael Kammen, Charles Liebman, Tamar Katriel, Elliott Oring, and Elchanan Orren for their helpful comments on earlier versions of this paper.

Following Halbwachs's pioneering approach to the study of collec- tive memory,2 this article explores the meaning of Tel Hai as it was con- structed in public discourse, focusing upon two periods of conflict within Israeli society. Thus it is not a historical study of the event that took place at Tel Hai in 1920, but a study of how this event has been remembered and reinterpreted in Israeli culture. The literature on national myths often emphasizes their function of re- inforcing solidarity among members of the society. Hence the importance of new myths during the formative stage of a nation, when the need to foster social solidarity is more acutely felt. Yet a close examination of the rhetori- cal uses of the Tel Hai myth in Israeli political discourse demonstrates that a national myth can also become an agent of internal conflict. This study explores two controversies over the meaning of Tel Hai in which the intro- duction of alternative readings of the myth served to challenge existing poli- tical hegemony. The different interpretations of Tel Hai, supported by liter- ary and folkloric texts that the myth inspired, presented competing claims on the Israeli collective memory and offered alternative courses of action. In pursuing this approach, the study is part of a growing body of literature that challenges the monolithic and static view of culture and explores how cultur- al texts serve different groups and political purposes at one and the same time or at different points in history.3 1. The term "myth" does not imply a negative evaluation of the narrative as either false or invalid but rather highlights its sacred character in a particular culture. 2. Maurice Halbwachs, The Collective Memory (1950; reprint ed., New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1980); Bernard Lewis, History: Remembered, Recovered, Invented (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1975); and Barry Schwartz, "The Social Context of Commemoration: A Study in Collective Memory," Social Forces 61 (1982): 374-398. In his Zakhor: Jewish History and Jewish Memory (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1982), Yosef Haim Yerushalmi offers a sweeping and penetrating analysis of the role of "group memory" in Jewish culture until the modern period, when "history" emerges as the main organizing principle of collective Jewish experience. This study maintains that in spite of its diminished role, collective memory still operates in the culture of contemporary Jewish groups. Collective memory offers a more selective and segmented representation of the past which may differ from the known historical records but may have greater impact on the group's perception of its own past. 3.

Adding on two casualties that had been incurred before this attack, the death toll at Tel Hai amounted to eight. Although there had been several shooting incidents involving Jews and Arabs in the preceding ten years,4 the settlers saw the fight at Tel Hai more as a battle than an "incident." Moreover, eight dead was a high figure for the small Yishuv. The loss of Yoseph Trumpeldor, one of the few Jewish set- tlers with extensive military experience, added to the traumatic impact of the fall of Tel Hai. A veteran of the tsarist army who had lost an arm in combat and been decorated for bravery, second-in-command of the Zion Mule Corps during World War I, and an active Zionist, Trumpeldor was a well- known figure in the Yishuv.5 His death contributed to the collective feeling of loss and grief following the battle of Tel Hai. That the return to the Land of Israel and the revival of Jewish national life would entail personal sacrifice was hardly a new idea for the Jewish settlers of the time. Zionists in Palestine and abroad often emphasized the value of collective sacrifice for the rebuilding of the nation and regarded self-defense as central to the Zionist transformation of the Diaspora life and mentality. This idea received its clearest expression in the famous slogan of the Bar Giora and Ha-Shomer defense organizations, which had been formed a decade earlier: "With fire and blood Judea fell, with fire and blood will Judea rise." That this verse (borrowed from Ya'acov Cahan's poem 4.

Note that the identity of the enemy was still ambiguous in this period and early references to Tel Hai used "Bedouins," "bandits," and "Arabs" interchangeably.

For further information on Trumpeldor, see the most recent biography by Shulamit Laskov, Trumpeldor: Sipur Hayav (Haifa: Shikmona, 1972). Trumpeldor was president of the Halutz movement in Russia when he returned to Palestine in 1919 to make arrangements for the future arrival of the Halutz members. It was then that he was asked to help organize the defense of the frontier settlements in the Upper Galilee. Trumpeldor regarded his stay in Tel Hai as temporary and planned to resume his mission of leading the Halutz youth to Palestine.</page><page sequence="4">136 YAEL ZERUBAVEL "Shir ha-Biryonim") was written after the Kishinev pogrom of 1903 is characteristic of the rising importance of self-defense as a response to the persecution and "humiliation" of two thousand years of Jewish life in exile.6 The early settlers of Israel saw Tel Hai as a dramatic event that exempli- fied this change. Trumpeldor's reputed last words, "Never mind, it is good to die for our country," further highlighted the Zionist pioneer's new heroic spirit. The settlers therefore hailed Tel Hai as a turning point that marked the beginning of a new era in Jewish history and the emergence of a new type of Jew in the Land of Israel. This theme was repeatedly restated at com- memorative gatherings in honor of those who had died in the Upper Galilee and in the numerous eulogies and articles published in the Hebrew news- papers.7 Anxious to develop a sacred symbol that would help shape the ideological foundations of their new society, the founders of modern Israel soon turned the historical event at Tel Hai into a national myth, and Trum- peldor emerged as the first national hero of the young Israeli society. The commemoration of Tel Hai Day on the eleventh of Adar supported the myth with an annual ritual. Within a few years, a new tradi- tion of youth pilgrimages to Tel Hai began developing. Public schools had classes and programs about Tel Hai on the eleventh of Adar, and many localities organized public commemorations. Tel Hai Day provided a major opportunity to educate the young in the spirit of Tel Hai and helped shape its meaning as an example of the fulfillment of the historical mission of settling, working, and defending the land. Poems, songs, stories, and plays glorifying "the amputee hero" (ha-gibor ha-gidem) who had fought and died for his country underscored the message of Tel Hai. This literature articulated the great admiration for the defenders of Tel Hai and a growing desire to turn this historical event into a pedagogical "legend."' This litera- 6.

During this early period, Tel Hai fulfilled the classical role of a national myth in a young nation in the process of defining its historical mission and forming its social and cultural foundations. Like other national myths, Tel Hai provided a symbolic representation of collective death and rebirth that dramatized the beginning of a new historical phase: the blood of the dead heroes sanctified the return to Israel and the renewed ties to the land.9 The Jewish settlers' immediate response to the historical event indi- cated that they agreed on its political and educational significance as the embodiment of the new pioneering ethos. The status of Tel Hai as a unifying national symbol for the Yishuv society and the Zionist movement was evident from the attempts made by groups of diverse political orienta- tions to use the names Tel Hai and Trumpeldor as part of their symbolic identity.'0 But even though the settlers put aside past and present disagree- ments in order to create a unified Tel Hai myth, those differences were soon to enter the political discourse and transform the myth text.

This theme appeared time and again in public references to Tel Hai during the early years. See, for example, Moshe Smilansky, "Makom Kadosh," Ha-Aretz, March 14, 1920, p. 1; Yoseph Klausner, "Hem Naflu H.alalim," Ha-Aretz, March 9, 1920, p. 2; Hadash, "Misaviv: Al Mot Gibor," Ha-Poel ha-Tsair, March 12, 1920, p. 26; see also Liebman and Don-Yehiya, Civil Religion, p. 45. 10. An experimentalist group of Halutz members in Palestine formed Gedud ha-Avoda al Shem Yoseph Trumpeldor and a few years later named their new communal settlement Tel Yoseph. Trumpeldor's name was also selected by a Zionist group named the Yoseph Trumpel- dor Guard Association (C. Ben-Yerulam, ed., Sefer Betar: Korot u-Mekorot [Jerusalem: Betar, 1969], vol. 1, p. 76) and by a commune of Halutz members in Poland called Kibbutz Tel Hai. (Yaacov Zilberscheid and Arie Pialkov, eds., Tel Hai: Sipur Hakhshara be-Polin [Tel Aviv: Ha-Kibbutz ha-Meulhad, 1969], p. 7). At the same time a group of students influenced by Ze'ev Jabotinsky formed a new youth movement, Betar, named after the last stronghold of Bar-Kokhba's revolt against the Romans in 135 C.E., but also an acronym for Brit Yoseph Trumpeldor. To achieve this desired double meaning, the Betarists changed the Hebrew spell- ing of Trumpeldor (from tet to tav) to fit the spelling of the ancient place-name. Betar selected "Tel Hai" as a form of greeting, and the Revisionists named their financial body Keren Tel Hai.</page><page sequence="6">138 YAEL ZERUBAVEL Yishuv. Yet during this period, new political developments shattered the Yishuv's earlier agreement on the meaning of the myth and made it a subject of public controversy. Throughout the thirties and the forties, an intense conflict between the two major Zionist movements, the Socialist Zionists and the Revisionists, dominated the political life of the Yishuv. In the pre- vailing hostile atmosphere, each party attempted to align the myth with its own political stance and accused the other of manipulating the past for political purposes. The heated dispute about the meaning of the myth pro- vided another arena for the political struggle between the two movements. The Socialists and the Revisionists advocated different reactions to the deteriorating political situation in Palestine and abroad. The escalation of tensions between Arabs and Jews in Palestine, the British restrictions on Jewish immigration following the Arab Revolt of 1936-39, the worsening plight of Jewish communities in Europe, and the outbreak of World War II intensified the internal debate on appropriate policies. In spite of pressures from within," the Labor movement advocated self-defense with restraint vis-a-vis the Arabs, official cooperation with the British mandatory author- ities, and continued covert organization and training of the Hagana under- ground. The Revisionists called for open opposition to both the Arabs and the British in Palestine and aggressive encouragement of illegal Jewish immigration. The two undergrounds that embraced the militant Revisionist policy (Irgun Zvai Leumi and Lohamei Heirut Israel) pursued independent terrorist actions in defense of the Jewish national cause. As these issues brought about a polarization within the Yishuv, each side sought to use Tel Hai in support of its own political and ideological stance in the ongoing conflict. The ensuing controversy focused on both the historical event and the myth it had generated. Whereas the discussion of the past event ultimately led to a debate on the moral right to use the myth, the dis- pute over its current interpretation essentially presented conflicting ideolo- gical claims on Tel Hai. The discussion of the past revived the debate about the defensibility of 11.

Reminding the Revisionists that in 1920 Jabotinsky had declared that the Jewish settlements in the northern Galilee could not be defended and had called for an immediate evacuation,12 the Socialist Zionists condemned the use of the names Tel Hai and Trumpeldor by Betar, the Revisionist youth movement. As the Socialists saw it, the Revisionists had betrayed the defenders of Tel Hai in a time of need and therefore had no moral right to use the battle, and the names of the fallen heroes, as their symbols. By co- opting the sacred myth of Tel Hai and its major commander, Yoseph Trumpeldor, the Revisionists were manipulating the past for their own poli- tical purposes. One should not blur and falsify the historical truth; one cannot put a new face on the people of Tel Hai. One should not forget that the Tel Hai heroes fought and fell in a two-front war: not only the war against bandits who wished to destroy a place of peace and labor, but also a war against indifference, help- lessness, alienation, and fear at home, in the Yishuv and among its leaders. One should not forget their horrible isolation there and the response of the believers in "pure nationalism," those who had the ability and the influence [to help].'3 Jabotinsky responded to the Socialist accusation by reiterating his ear- lier position on the defense of the northern settlements. In an article entitled "Between the Sixth and the Eleventh of Adar," Jabotinsky reconstructed the events that had led to the fall of Tel Hai and defended his earlier analysis of the situation. Explaining why the decision to defend the settlements had been unrealistic, he maintained that he had shown better judgment and more concern for the settlers by calling for their immediate withdrawal than those who had let them expect help to no avail. Jabotinsky now went further than he had in 1920, directly blaming the Socialists for the death of the defenders of Tel Hai and thereby denying their moral right to the myth.

He requested this, gentlemen, because he predicted that you would not send any aid in spite of all your rhetoric about heroism. And knowing this, he thought that one should not desert people to be slaughtered when one could not provide aid!'4 There is a huge difference between the defenders of Tel Hai who were physical- ly on the spot and those who defended Tel Hai from a distance. The former had the right to be heroic and stay in the settlement, even when no aid was forthcoming. But those who served on the Provisional Committee, far away from there, had no right to tell the Tel Hai people, "Be heroes and do not with- draw."' 5 Interest in the historical debate was far from academic. Underlying it was the desire of each movement to claim the moral right to the myth on the basis of the events which had led to the fall of Tel Hai in 1920 and to deny the other movement's right to do the same. Thus the debate did not bring out any new information relating to the historical defense of Tel Hai. In the thirties and the forties, history was of interest to the rival parties only so long as it proved or disproved their moral claim to the myth. The resumption of the 1920 dispute about the defense of the Upper Galilee a decade afterward is all the more interesting if we consider that immediately following the fall of Tel Hai, the parties involved in the debate had tacitly agreed to set aside their previous disagreements on this issue. As Eliyahu Golomb, who was a member of the commission sent to Tel Hai in March 1920, wrote: "After the event, there were no further arguments about the importance of the heroic stand of the Tel Hai defenders and of its value as a symbol and a model for the Yishuv and the entire Jewish world."'6 It was the widening political gap between the Socialists and the Re- visionists that led to the renewal of the debate. In this controversy, Jabo- tinsky's main line of argument was to separate the historical event from the myth in order to justify both his earlier opposition to the defense and his later glorification of it. The Labor movement, on the other hand, denied the 14.

For the Socialists, only those who had been in favor of defending Tel Hai in 1920 had the moral right to glorify that event and use it as their political symbol. The disagreement over the meaning of the Tel Hai myth provided yet another front for the Revisionist-Socialist conflict. The rival interpretations of the myth did not simply highlight the ideological differences between the movements; they also served as a useful means for mobilizing political sup- port and attacking any policies of the other movement which deemed incon- sistent with Tel Hai. By co-opting the myth for their own political purposes, the two movements were attempting to capitalize on its value as a major sacred text of the pioneering era. While Tel Hai's status as a national myth was unquestioned-the controversy revolved around the issue of inter- pretation. Each movement redefined "pioneering" in accordance with its political program, supported by its own version of Tel Hai. The Revisionists empha- sized the heroic, activist spirit of the defenders of Tel Hai, their strong sense of national mission, and their readiness for personal sacrifice. The Socialists did not neglect the heroic aspect but focused on the defenders' commitment to the ideology of settling and working the land. Since there was no disagree- ment about the heroic element of the myth, the dispute shifted to the theme of settlement and work. While the Socialists regarded this as central to the Tel Hai myth, the Revisionists denied its significance. Today, the difference between these positions may seem quite insignifi- cant. But at the time it represented one of the fundamental areas of disagree- ment between two conflicting political orientations. On more purely ideolo- gical grounds, the Socialist interpretation of Tel Hai integrated nationalism with socialism, whereas the Revisionist interpretation supported the princi- ple of "monism," namely, exclusive adherence to nationalist Zionist ideology."7 But the different versions of the myth also had a direct bearing on the immediate political scene. The Revisionists mobilized Tel Hai in sup- port of their call for armed resistance, maintaining that it was a symbolic expression of armed confrontation, blood, and sacrifice as central principles of the Yishuv's national ideology. The Labor movement, in contrast, saw it as supporting their advocacy of restraint on the use of force against the 17.

In a polemic published on the anniversary of Trumpeldor's death, Jabo- tinsky pointed out that Trumepeldor was remembered primarily as a mili- tary hero and that this image would live on in the nation's collective memory. This point, he maintained, was relevant to the ongoing Revision- ist-Labor conflict. Among those who praise him [Trumpeldor], there are vocal opponents of any- thing related to the sword, the gun, and the pistol. But Trumpeldor's name is primarily associated with these weapons and others .... In the collective memory of our people, Trumpeldor has essentially been remembered as a soldier." Aba Ahimeir, the spokesman for a more radical faction of Revisionist youths, expressed a similar idea in a more confrontational style. But what do they [the Socialists] have to do with Trumpeldor? Why don't they go on pilgrimage to the grave of [the Socialist ideologue] A. D. Gordon? Why do they too go on pilgrimage to the distant grave of Trumpeldor the militarist, Trumpeldor who volunteered for the Zion Mule Corps in Gallipoli . . . ?9 Arguing that Trumpeldor had devoted his life to Jewish nationalism and military activism, the Revisionists maintained that their version of Tel Hai represented the historical man more faithfully than the Socialists'. To prove that Trumpeldor had been primarily concerned with political and activist issues rather than a Socialist agenda, Revisionist educational materials selected quotations imbued with this spirit from Trumpeldor's writings.20 18.

Jabotinsky interpreted Trumpeldor's famous expression, "Never mind," as representing the essence of the hero's vision of the pioneering ideal and denied its relevance to socialism. Thus, the halutz (pioneer) is "neither a 'landlord' nor a peasant . .. neither a guard nor even a common worker."2" Instead, Jabotinsky redefined Trumpeldor's "Never mind" in strongly nationalist terms, in line with the current Revisionist position, basing this interpretation on a private conversation with Trumpeldor for which no other source is available.22 By legitimately claiming exclusive knowledge of Trumpeldor's views as well as a direct chain of transmission between the dead hero and his own Revisionist followers, Jabotinsky presented the latter as the authentic heirs of the legacy of Tel Hai. The Labor movement, meanwhile, interpreted Tel Hai as a myth of settlement, work, and defense. To dramatize its differences with the Revi- sionists, the Labor movement focused on Trumpeldor's ideological commit- ment to building Jewish settlements and working the land. Although this theme also appeared in earlier references to Tel Hai, Trumpeldor had usual- ly been portrayed in accordance with the conventional image of the halutz as the worker and defender who "with one hand held the plow and with the other held his weapon."23 Even if the plow came before the gun, both tools were clearly represented in Trumpeldor's earlier mythical image. In Trum- peldor's case, however, the image required some modification because his left arm had been amputated. The hero was, therefore, portrayed as holding the plow and the gun in one hand. If the joined symbols of plow and gun served to glorify the ability of the average halutz to carry out the demanding tasks of plowing and standing guard, Trumpeldor obviously rose above all 21. Jabotinsky, "Al Trumpeldor," p. 54 and also in his Sipur Yamai (Jerusalem: Ari Jabo- tinsky, 1947), pp. 205-206. It is interesting to note that when Jabotinsky first directed public attention to Trumpeldor's "Never mind" a few days after his death, he offered a different interpretation of its meaning. In 1920, Jabotinsky hailed the hero's "Never mind" as a symbolic expression of his power of determination, resilience, and humbleness (Ha-Aretz, March 8, 1920, p. 1). 22. Goldstein and Shavit, "Trumpeldor," p. 16; Shavit, Me-Rov li-Medina, pp. 266-268. 23. This image of the pioneer, based on Nehemiah 4:11, was popular among the early Jewish settlers. The Hagana and Palmah undergrounds continued to emphasize the double commitment to work and defense as represented in this image.</page><page sequence="12">144 YAEL ZERUBAVEL other pioneers. Indeed,Trumpeldor's determination to perform difficult physical feats in spite of his disability had been a source of admiration dur- ing his lifetime as well.24 But the Socialists could clearly benefit from claim- ing that his personal commitment to the plow was proof that he had adhered to the Socialist Zionist ideology. The debate on the meaning of the Tel Hai myth during the thirties and the forties can be seen as a power struggle over the shaping of the Yishuv's collective memory from the vantage point of the ongoing political conflict between the two movements. The rival interpretations of the Tel Hai nar- rative used the gun and the plow as visual emblems of nationalism and socialism respectively. Although the Labor movement originally used both implements as important symbols of Socialist Zionism it now attempted to assert the plow's superiority over the gun. By introducing a hierarchical order in this horizontal image (which initially had implied a balance bet- ween the two implements), the Socialists wished to establish a clear-cut contrast with the Revisionists' worship of weapons and armed struggle. The Socialists, therefore, made the plow the central icon of the Tel Hai myth. Their educational materials for the eleventh of Adar highlighted Trumpel- dor as settler and worker, holding his gun only to protect the plow with which he tilled the fields. They were not the heroes of the sword and the spear, but the heroes of the spade and the plow. The weapon did not come but for the builder's cubit. They knew how to die as heroes because they knew how to live as heroes, the heroes of work and construction.25 The Socialists stressed time and again that the defenders of Tel Hai who had been members of the Labor movement, had been filled with "love of the nation and the land, and believed in the principles of labor and social jus- tice."26 Trumpeldor himself, so the Socialists claimed, had been committed to socialism and interested in the Labor movement's activities. The Social- ists never doubted that the dead hero had been one of their own, and to prove the point they, too, turned to Trumpeldor's writings in search of 24. Laskov, Trumpeldor, pp. 84-85. 25.

Their educational materials for the Tel Hai Day included a sampling of Trumpeldor's statements that suited their purpose. Not a sword but peace we bring to the Land of Israel. Only the most extraordinary circumstances will force us to exchange our spades for swords. Remember! you do not go to the Land of Israel for heroic acts, nor to make sacrifices, but for work!27 To support their interpretations of the myth, the rival movements drew upon the growing body of oral and written literature inspired by Tel Hai and often used in ceremonies on the eleventh of Adar. Since the plow and the gun both featured prominently as symbols in the literature of the period, each movement was selectively able to find literary support for its position in the conflict. A popular children's story, framed as personal memoir, recounts how Yoseph Trumpeldor led a small group of pioneers to examine the damage that Arabs had inflicted on Khamra, a Jewish settlement near Tel Hai. The pioneers found the place burned down and the fields deserted. As they approached the field, they saw a plow that had been left behind. It appeared as a lifeless, cold, metal instrument, but it appealed to us as if it were a precious object. All of us surrounded the plow and stared at it. The plow was our symbol: they [the Arabs] have weapons and we have a plow. They left our plow here. They did not take it. "We will take the plow to Tel Hai!" Trumpeldor exclaimed after a pro- longed silence, "We will go on plowing and sowing the land." As they were about to leave for Tel Hai, the Arabs resumed the attack. Under the enemy's sniping bullets, Trumpeldor carried the plow all the way back to Tel Hai. When they finally arrived there safely, one of his com- rades asked him: "Did you risk your life for one plow, Yoseph!?"... "This is not merely a plow," Yoseph solemnly replied, "this is our flag, the 27. Zekher Yemei Tel Hai (Tel Aviv: Teachers' Council for the Jewish National Fund, 1960), p. 20; Tel Hai.

And one cannot abandon a flag to the hands of the enemy."28 A simple reading of the story suggests the importance of the plow as a major national symbol for Trumpeldor and his friends and demonstrates the Arabs' failure to understand the significance of this unassuming object. But when applied to the Socialist-Revisionist conflict, the text gains a biting edge, for it implies an analogy between the Revisionists and the Arabs: both believe in the power of weapons to win a war but miss the ideological and moral strength that the plow bestows on its followers.29 Trumpeldor's attachment to the plow also appears as the central theme of a popular song for the Tel Hai Day (the original Hebrew is composed in rhyme): In the Galilee Yoseph plowed And he was singing all along: "My plow is with me, with me, My plow is my work, My joy and my flag... My plow is with me, with me." In the Galilee Yoseph fell But the song did not die out: My plow is with me, with me. It is good to die for my country- With my hand on my plow. My plow is with me, with me.30 Another poem describes the miracles performed by "the hero of Tel Hai" who made the wasteland bloom. This poem (in contrast to Jabotinsky's interpretation discussed above) links Trumpeldor's famous "Never mind" to the ideal of working the land. Is the cliff burning? Is the thorn pricking? 28.

It is interesting to compare this story's representation of the value of the plow with a testimony on a similar statement by members of Ha-Shomer which articulated the feeling that "none of us will desert the plow as long as he lives" (Yisrael Giladi, quoted in Gorni, "Ha- Yesod ha-Romanti," p. 64). 30.

"Never mind!"3' To counter the Socialist use of the plow as the emblem of the Zionist pioneer, the Revisionists turned to a story that illustrates how the defenders of Tel Hai had a special attachment to the national flag. According to the story, the settlers made themselves a flag out of a plain white sheet painted in blue. Throughout the battle with the Arabs, the improvised flag, pierced by enemy bullets, flew on high. Following the attack, the survivors left Tel Hai, carrying the bodies of their dead comrades wrapped in the flag. But when the Jewish settlers later returned to Tel Hai, they brought the flag back with them. Stained with blood and riddled with holes, it served as the sym- bol of the defense during future commemorations of the eleventh of Adar in Tel Hai.32 Interestingly enough, the plow and flag stories were both written by the same author, Eliezer Smally, who was a teacher in Kefar Giladi in the twen- ties and published stories about settler life.33 Their symbolic juxtaposition in the educational materials of the two movements, therefore, appears to have been imposed on the texts for political purposes rather than intended by the author. Similarly, during the first few years following the defense of Tel Hai, the plow and the gun were not juxtaposed in public discourse, and the themes of heroic last stand, activism, settlement, and working the land were used interchangeably and across the political spectrum. In 1921, for exam- ple, the writer Yoseph Haim Brenner, who published in Socialist publica- tions, stated that Trumpeldor was "first and foremost a military man"; while Jabotinsky wrote two poems about the Tel Hai defenders which por- tray them plowing the fields.34 Jabotinsky, at this time, had no qualms about 31.

By emphasizing their separate interpretations of the myth, the Revision- ists and the Socialists highlighted their political differences. Projecting these differences onto the past, each movement attempted to prove itself the legiti- mate heir of the Tel Hai legacy. Trumpeldor's writings and career were so diverse that neither movement had any difficulty finding support for its position. Trumpeldor was a complex figure, and his personal correspon- dence encompassed a wide range of issues. He was inclined toward socialism and even tried to lay out systematic guidelines for future Jewish communal settlements.35 Shortly before his death, Trumpeldor published an open letter to the Socialist parties in the Yishuv, urging them to consolidate their forces in order to improve economic conditions in Palestine and help accommo- date future Jewish immigrants.36 Yet Trumpeldor was also deeply concerned with issues relating to Jewish activism which brought him and Jabotinsky together. When Trumpeldor returned to Palestine in December 1919, it was Jabotinsky who wrote an article in his praise and complained about the Yishuv's failure to give him a hero's welcome. And it was Jabotinsky, again, who gave the key eulogy at the public commemoration of the Tel Hai hero immediately after his death.37 Interestingly enough, Trumpeldor himself addressed the question of his ideological priorities in a letter to a friend as early as 1911 in which he stated: "I have found no conflict between Zionism and communism, and I do not believe that this will become an issue for me in the future."38 Although the Revisionist attempt to play down the importance of Trum- peldor's personal commitment to socialism was not justified, Jabotinsky was correct in predicting that Trumpeldor would eventually be remembered 35.

When the Revisionist- Socialist conflict subsided following the foundation of the State of Israel, there was no longer any need to separate the dimensions of work and defense. The gun and the plow, previously presented as polar representa- tions of competing ideological systems, were restored to their earlier, more balanced partnership. That public school textbooks portrayed them as complementary symbols of the Israeli pioneering ethos may also reflect the Labor movement's hegemony in Israeli politics until the late seventies.39 Although Tel Hai is predominantly a myth of heroism and national sacri- fice, this interpretation of the myth is not necessarily associated with either Betar or the Revisionists.40 The intensity of the debate indicated the myth's enormous political signi- ficance as a sacred text from the past that provided a model and legitimation for the present. It was not the historical event per se, but rather the encoding of its symbolic meaning, that provided fuel for this controversy. While the myth became an instrument of the political struggle for hegemony and helped shape the political discourse during the conflict, the struggle also modified the political and educational meaning of the myth. Tel Hai Revisited: The Ambiguity of Success The myth of Tel Hai once again became the subject of a political contro- versy in the late seventies and early eighties, when a new wave of newspaper articles, radio and television programs, and public debates brought Tel Hai back into the limelight. The renewal of interest in both the historical event and the interpretation of the myth was particularly significant in view of the 39. See, for example, L. Kipnis, A. Buchner and Y. Levinton, eds., Sefer ha-Kitah Gimel (Tel Aviv: Dvir, 1962); Z. Ariel, Z. Vilensky, and N. Persky, eds., Alfoni: Sefer le-Khita Alef (Jerusalem: Masada, 1968); and N.

Among the 120 people I interviewed on the meaning of Tel Hai in the late seventies (Israeli public school students aged twelve to fourteen and their parents), only a handful men- tioned Betar in conjunction with Tel Hai. All who made this association, except for one student, were parents who remembered the Revisionist-Socialist conflict from their own youth.</page><page sequence="18">150 YAEL ZERUBAVEL gradual decline Tel Hai had gone through after the foundation of the state. Although it continued to be an important educational text used by schools, youth movements, and the army, its significance in Israel's political culture had diminished greatly. The decline of the Tel Hai myth was part of the current weakening of Israel's secular national ethos, generated by the East European Jewish set- tlers in the early Yishuv period. The nationalist-heroic lore that was essen-. tial for the nation in its formative stages lost much of its appeal after the first years of adjustment to statehood. As the new state struggled with major social, economic, and political problems, the gap between the romantic expectations of the pre-state period and the reality of the fifties led to skepti- cism and cynicism among Israelis brought up on the national Hebrew cul- ture of the Yishuv. The changing mood during this time of transition was captured by a group of young Israeli writers: Our present reality is not the enthusiastic atmosphere of the war years.... Our reality now is gray, faded, and grim.... The naivete, this youthful belief that we would "conquer the world" with our own strength, has vanished. Skepticism, cynicism, and bewilderment have taken its place. We should, therefore, avoid pompous declarations and commitments that might lead to a great disappointment.41 This new sense of disillusionment led young Israelis to react against the per- vasive use of flowery ideological slogans in Israeli educational and political discourse. Colloquial Hebrew \transformed the term "Zionism" to "Zionism in quotes" (tsionut be-merkhaot), implying a form of preaching with pathos and pomp but no substance, or a high-style discourse that evades the real issues. Starting in the late fifties, Israeli literature began to break away from its earlier emphasis on the construction of a nationalist-heroic Hebrew cul- ture, redefining its intellectual and aesthetic premises. A new cultural repre- sentation of the native Israeli appeared in literature, film, and theater, replacing the activist, self-assured, "positive" hero of the forties and the fifties with self-doubting, introspective, passive (and at times, self- destructive) characters. This trend, which culminated in the seventies and 41.

The glorified amputee hero of the pioneering period now became the butt of skepticism, cynicism, and gallows humor. His famous last words, "Never mind it is good to die for our country," the ultimate expression of patriotism for generations of Israelis, were now criti- cized on both historical and ideological grounds. As I have shown else- where, these cynical and humorous counter-myth texts used the familiar themes of the Tel Hai myth to subvert their meaning and thereby highlight the gaps between the myth and Israel's current reality.43 In this broader framework, the public debate on the meaning of the Tel Hai myth in the late seventies was rather unexpected. The reawakened inter- est in the myth was the result of the analogy that many Israelis saw between Tel Hai's historical role as a frontier settlement and Israel's new "frontier settlements" in Sinai, the Golan Heights, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. The debate on the future of these territories and the government's policy regarding the establishment of new Jewish settlements had been a major factor in Israeli political life since 1967. But the conflict escalated in the late seventies, during the peace negotiations with Egypt. Israeli political factions on the far right were vehemently opposed to making territorial con- 42. The concern with the demythologization of the Israeli hero sometimes leads to new literary reconstructions of the pioneering past (Aharon Megged's Ha-IHai al ha-met and Meir Shalev's Roman Russi are two notable examples) but has more often been explored in the con- text of contemporary Israeli life. Various works by A. B. Yehoshua, Amos Oz, Aharon Megged, Yitzhak Ben-Ner, Yitzhak Orpaz, Ya'acov Shabtai, and others have portrayed images of alienated, self-doubting Israelis who are dramatically different from the heroes of earlier Israeli literature.

Many of the settlers in the occupied territories objected to the evacuation of the Sinai settlements and participated in demonstrations organized by the Move- ment to Stop the Retreat; some others continued to resist the government's orders until they were removed from Sinai by force. In this heated atmosphere, the collective memory of Tel Hai emerged as a political issue once again. The relevance of Tel Hai to the current political conflict provoked a public discussion on the meaning of the myth as well as a renewed interest in the 1920 debate on the evacuation of the northern Gali- lee. Like their predecessors in the pre-state controversy over Tel Hai, each side in the debate attempted to mobilize the myth in support of its own posi- tion. But the focus of the controversy, changing in response to the broader political issues underlying the conflict at hand, shifted to the meaning of "success" and the role of the Tel Hai myth in shaping Israeli defense strategy. Because political alignments in the present conflict did not always correspond to earlier alignments around the myth, the reexamination of Tel Hai created some new ambiguities. In 1978, Israel's national radio and television networks devoted a series of programs to Tel Hai. The key person behind these programs was Nak- dimon Rogel, an Israeli journalist who had studied archival materials relating to the defense of Tel Hai and later published a book on the subject.44 Rogel's study of the historical situation in the Upper Galilee at the end of 1919 and the beginning of 1920 led him to challenge the interpretation of Tel Hai as a myth of no retreat that exemplified the successful defense of frontier settlements. Although Rogel's interest in Tel Hai was probably motivated by the myth's relevance to current political issues, his critique rekindled the old controversy between the Revisionists and the Socialists. Rogel supported the position Jabotinsky had taken in 1920, agreeing that Tel Hai could not have survived in the circumstances then prevailing in the Upper Galilee. Moreover, his analysis suggested that the Socialist leaders were at fault for insisting that the Jewish settlements be defended but failing to provide the aid that would have made this possible. According to Rogel, Tel Hai devel- oped into a major national myth of a successful strategy of settlement and 44. Nakdimon Rogel, Tel Hai: Hlazit lelo Oref (Tel Aviv: Yariv-Hadar, 1979).</page><page sequence="21">TEL HAI IN ISRAEL'S COLLECTIVE MEMORY 153 defense because the Labor leaders were trying to redeem themselves by plac- ing a high value on Tel Hai's long-term contribution to Israel's territorial gains. It is a little wonder, then, that old-time Revisionists welcomed Rogel's much-publicized position on the 1920 debate. Since Jabotinsky's historic opposition to the defense of Tel Hai, incongruent with the Revisionists' mili- tancy in future decades, was a sensitive point for the Revisionists they tend- ed to see Rogel's statements as a public rehabilitation of his 1920 position on Tel Hai.45 No less predictably, though, Laborites criticized Rogel's under- standing of the historical issues, again emphasizing Trumpeldor's affinity to their movement and clearing their leaders of the charge of neglect by blam- ing everything on the Yishuv's collective institutions.46 Despite the new information provided by Rogel's study, the revival of the old debate about the defensibility of the Upper Galilee differed more in style than in substance from the earlier revival in the thirties and forties. The dispute in the late seventies and the early eighties was more academic in nature than the earlier one and lacked the popular zeal that had accompan- ied it. When the Socialist-Revisionist conflict began, Tel Hai was still a recent event, and people who had been involved in the original discussion in 1920 were still alive and politically active. In the late seventies and early eighties, both the historical event and the Socialist-Revisionist controversy seemed to belong to a distant past. This round of the debate, therefore, was marked by greater detachment. In contrast to the discussion about the 1920 debate, Rogel's attempt to demythologize Tel Hai triggered a more emotional response. Rogel chal- lenged the sacred core of the myth, which held that the defense had ultimate- ly been worthwhile and that the defenders' self-sacrifice had great political significance. Thus his critique targeted two widely held beliefs: (1) that Tel Hai represented a firm resolve never to abandon a Jewish settlement, and (2) 45.

Rogel emphasized that although the settlers had made a firm commit- ment to remain in Tel Hai and their leaders supported an anti-withdrawal policy, the settlers eventually retreated from the northern Galilee after the attack of March 1, 1920. Moreover, he maintained, the battle of Tel Hai and the subsequent evacuation had no impact on the final agreement between the British and the French on the location of the northern border of Palestine.47 Hence, despite what the myth suggests, neither the heroic defense nor the blood spilled on the land ultimately led to any long-term ter- ritorial gains. Rogel's radical rereading of what had happened at Tel Hai in 1920 chal- lenged Israel's collective memory of this event as a successful model of hold- ing on to settlements at all costs. The Tel Hai myth began to develop this meaning soon after the battle, and it was accepted by different political elements of the Yishuv. Just a few days after the fall of Tel Hai, Jabotinsky publicly mourned "the men who knew no retreat" and Joseph Klausner praised the settlers for their firm belief that no Jewish settlement in the Land of Israel should be abandoned.48 Similarly, an editorial in the Socialist pub- lication Ha-Poel ha-Tsair on March 12, 1920, stated that "we will not give up any portion of our land, we will not abandon any outpost." A statement made by Aharon Scher (one of the first casualties at Tel Hai)-"One does not desert a place, nor give up that which has been built"-was published posthumously and, along with Trumpeldor's last words, served as an impor- tant theme in the Socialist interpretation of the legacy of Tel Hai.49 That "no retreat" had been Tel Hai's legacy for future generations was reinforced by educational materials published as late as the sixties and the seventies. Preschool children too learned the symbolic message of Tel Hai, transmitted to them in story form: "Yoseph told his friends: 'We will stand 47.

We shall guard the land that we have toiled on. We shall never desert the house that we have built.'"'5 Rogel attempted to demythologize Tel Hai by providing historical evi- dence that highlighted the myth's selective representation of the historical event and therefore challenged the myth's validity. The proponents of the myth, on the other hand, focused on its historical impact in shaping the Yishuv's settlement policy and the defense strategy that guaranteed its terri- torial claims. They reiterated the position that Tel Hai had inspired the establishment of the Hagana underground in 1920 and the foundation of the homa u-migdal settlements in the following decades.5' The popular designa- tion of the eleventh of Adar as Defense Day during the pre-state and early-state periods indicated Tel Hai's symbolic role in shaping Israeli con- ceptions of settlement and defense at the time. As the historian Elchanan Orren succinctly noted: "Every great act in the area of settlement and settle- ment policy has been inspired by Tel Hai."52 In fact, there seemed to be general agreement that Tel Hai was the dominant myth of settlement and defense during the pre-state period. The differences emerged with regard to evaluations of its effect. Advocates of the myth credited it with making a successful settlement and defense policy possible; others maintained that the strategic and political shortcomings of the Tel Hai model had undermined its success. Tel Hai, they said, offered a static, and rather reactive, conception of defense that later had to be modi- fied. As Anita Shapira observes, although the ethos of "defensive heroism" continued to prevail, after the late thirties, the Yishuv's defense policy in effect became more oriented to the offensive.53 Rogel's criticism, however, focused mainly on how the Tel Hai myth had led to the loss of human lives 50.

Indeed, although the debate about Tel Hai's influence on Israel's settle- ment and defense policy may have seemed dominated by a past orientation, the ongoing political dispute about the Jewish settlements in Sinai provided it with an acute sense of political relevance. The controversy over Tel Hai may have been precipitated by an earlier attempt by the Gush Emunim (literally "Bloc of the Faithful") movement to utilize the myth in support of its political agenda. Formulating its own brand of Israeli nationalism and Jewish fundamentalism, Gush Emunim had pursued an activist settlement policy since its formation in 1974 and forcefully advocated the permanent annexation of the post-1967 territories. Criticizing the decline of the Yishuv's pioneering spirit in contemporary Israel, Gush Emunim claimed to be the current bearer of the Zionist ideals of settlement and defense. To sup- port its position as a revitalizing movement, it adapted prominent national symbols of pioneering from the Yishuv period, such as Tel Hai, into its own political discourse.55 By using the highly respectable rhetoric of pioneering, the movement hoped to mobilize secular Israelis in support of its settlement policy and to legitimize its oppositionist agenda. Thus, for example, it was on the eleventh of Adar that Gush Emunim issued a public call for volunteers to join its settlements on the West Bank, thereby reinforcing its claim of continuity with the legacy of Tel Hai.56 There is a striking historical irony, however, in an essentially religious movement attempting to use the Tel Hai myth to promote its political program. Much of Trumpeldor's appeal in the early pre-state period stemmed from his being a modern, secularized Jew who offered a clear contrast to the stereotype of the religious Diaspora Jew. Tel Hai developed as a national myth by secularized Israelis, and the Orthodox 54. Rogel, Tel Hai, pp. 17, 19. 55.

The peace negotiations with Egypt and the plan for the evacuation of Jewish settlers from Sinai shifted the significance of Tel Hai from a legitimiz- ing myth of settlement (along with other historical models, such as homa u-migdal) to a more specific and urgent meaning as a myth of no retreat. Tel Hai became an important topic in Israeli political discourse because it offered a channel for discussing current political positions as well as the symbolic outcome of the retreat from Sinai. Israeli newspapers dealt with the analogy between the current situation in Sinai and that in the Upper Galilee in 1920, and Rogel's much-publicized position on the historical vali- dity of Tel Hai as a myth of no retreat added fuel to the controversy."58 Con- sider, for example, the use of the Tel Hai myth in the following critique of the Begin government: It so happened that sixty years after the events at Tel Hai, the situation on our southern border evokes arguments similar to those that took place in Trum- peldor's last days. A group of Betar members settled in Neot Sinai, and Jabo- tinsky's heir, Menachem Begin, either sincerely or as an empty gesture, expressed the wish to make it his future home. This home, so to speak, he gave up in order to negotiate and sign a peace treaty with Egypt. His friends at Neot Sinai woke up one morning and suddenly found that they were "a front with- out a rear." If they decide to follow Trumpeldor's route and do not evacuate their own Tel Hai, they will have to rebel, no matter what, not only against the 57. My interviews with students in two religious public schools revealed that many did not know who Trumpeldor was or only knew very little about him, mainly through the public media rather than from learning at school. Teachers explained that the proximity of the elev- enth of Adar to Purim prevents them from dedicating time to Tel Hai. 58.

The author resorts to the Tel Hai model in order to emphasize the enormous difference between the myth and the government's Sinai policy. He drama- tizes it further by presenting a pathetic contemporary version of the famous story of the deserted plow for which Trumpeldor risked his life. In order to sweeten the blow, the prime minister brought them [the settlers] a gift from his visit to Cairo-the washing machine that had been deserted dur- ing the first stage of the retreat [from Sinai] . . . and if Tel Hai has been the myth for settlement as territorial expansion, and if the monument of the roar- ing lion has been the site of pilgrimage for generations of youth, the washing machine will become the monument of Menachem Begin's shrinking myth of peace. The difference is, indeed, tremendous.59 Underlying the analogy between Tel Hai in 1920 and Sinai of the late seventies were the following questions: Did the position of the Jewish set- tlers in Sinai resemble that of their predecessors in the Upper Galilee in 1920? Had the government betrayed the Tel Hai legacy by agreeing to abandon Jewish settlements in return for peace? Could the last stand at Tel Hai serve as a model for contemporary Israeli settlers who opposed the evacuation of Sinai? Because the controversy in the late seventies and early eighties encompassed several issues-the 1920 debate on the defensibility of the Upper Galilee, the historical validity of the Tel Hai myth, and the myth's relevance of the ongoing conflict on the future of the occupied territories-it sometimes diffused earlier political alignments around the interpretation of Tel Hai. The political tensions between the various levels of this controversy were quite real: If one accepted as valid the myth itself as well as its influence on earlier Israeli history, did this imply that one must support contemporary policies of settling the post-1967 territories and oppose the retreat from Sinai? Or put differently, if one agreed with Rogel's critique of Tel Hai as a successful strategy of settlement and defense, and with his warning that it created a dangerous model, did this necessarily lead to support for the eva- cuation from Sinai? Territorial maximalists could easily embrace the view that there was a continuity between the past as represented by the Tel Hai 59.

Continuing to maintain Tel Hai's historical importance, they denied the basis for the analogy between the past and the present. Once again, the interpretation of the Tel Hai myth became an arena for conflict over con- temporary policies. As before, the Tel Hai controversy encompassed both the historical event and the myth. But whereas the earlier round had taken place when Tel Hai still enjoyed a prominent status in Israeli political cul- ture, the later round erupted when the myth was in decline. In the thirties and the forties, both sides agreed on Tel Hai's significance as a myth but argued over its meaning. In the late seventies and early eighties, the process of mythologization was itself part of the debate. In both cases, it was the myth's relevance for the present that determined the orientation of the dis- course and accounted for changes in the rhetorical uses of Tel Hai. Conclusion The study of the politics of interpreting Tel Hai reveals that a myth can enhance social solidarity in some situations and also can reinforce divisive tendencies in others. The use of Tel Hai in two Israeli political conflicts shows that a myth's meaning may vary not only at different times, but also as different groups construct competing versions of it. National myths can shape a society's perception of its past and influence its views of the present, but they also provide a powerful tool for marginal groups that wish to enter the political arena. Whereas dominant movements attempt to perpetuate their political hegemony (and marginalize other groups) by disseminating a self-serving version of the national mythology, the same myths can be used by oppositionist groups to challenge this hege- mony. By introducing different versions of the myth, such groups can legiti- mize their entry into mainstream political discourse and offer an alternative political agenda. A close look at two debates over Tel Hai demonstrates this process at work. In two different periods, a marginal political movement attempted to move toward the center by claiming the moral right to use and interpret the myth, simultaneously denying the center's right to do the same. The use of the myth in these conflict situations furthered ideological cleavages and highlighted political tensions in Israeli society. The study also demonstrates how a national myth may be used to</page><page sequence="28">160 YAEL ZERUBAVEL emphasize symbolic continuities and discontinuities between past and pres- ent. Tel Hai's role as a symbolic representation of the pioneering ethos has persisted even when there have been disagreements about other aspects of the myth. But the meaning of "pioneering" has been transformed in differ- ent periods and by different groups. In each of the disputes discussed in this essay, a group claimed that it was the authentic heir of the Tel Hai legacy, thus holding the key to symbolic continuity in the future. In each case, the need to delineate this continuity determined the focus of the controversy and the different readings of the myth. Analysis of the Tel Hai myth also indicates that the development of sym- bolic texts is neither linear nor uniform. In the case of Tel Hai, the intensifi- cation of an internal political dispute in the late seventies and early eighties was in fact instrumental to infusing new blood into the myth after a period of relative decline. It was the power of the myth to confront present issues through the discussion of the past that renewed the political interest in Tel Hai. The myth which had always been an important educational text, then resurfaced as an active political instrument. Indeed, the emergence of cyni- cal and humorous counter-myth texts attests to its continuing presence in Israel's collective memory. The multiplicity of texts relating to Tel Hai dis- closes the intricate political fabric of Israeli society and the important role that symbolic texts serve in mediating between past and present.
