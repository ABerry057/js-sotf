<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hyam Maccoby. Antisemitism and Modernity: Innovation and Continuity. New York: Routledge, 2006. xiv, 189 pp. doi:10.1017/S0364009408001463 Antisemitism and Modernity is a posthumous work, the last contribution of a long and notable career. Readers benefit from the breadth of Maccoby's knowledge as well as the originality of his analysis. Most notable in the book is the intensity with which Maccoby inquires into the origins and power of antisemitic myth, attempting to explain the underlying causes and endurance of antisemitism. Reaching back to antiquity and working up until the present day, Maccoby attempts to explain antise mitism and especially to reveal the causes of the Holocaust. He insists on the central ity of Christian theology and Christian traditions to the development of antisemitism through the centuries. For him, modern antisemitism derives directly from medieval antisemitism. Some will argue that this sort of central thesis, carried through centuries of historical and literary contexts, is too single-minded and that the book, because of its scope, glosses over too many historical nuances. These criticisms have some merit, but what I find very valuable about this book is Maccoby's emphasis on the medieval roots of antisemitism, which are often glossed over or ignored when later manifestations of antisemitism are studied. Maccoby traces these medieval roots through multiple permutations: the Reformation, the Enlightenment, Marxist millenarianism, and, finally, Nazism. The section on the Reformation deals almost exclusively with Martin Luther, whose writings he sees as a "foreshadowing" of the Holocaust (44). He also argues that what he sees as the advances of the Reformation came at a price: Lutheranism, he proposes, wiped away the Catholic "safeguard" sometimes referred to as Augustinian toleration and "transmitted from the sixteenth century to the time of Hitler a hate-filled, murderous concept of the Jews that was even more dangerous and explosive than that of the Middle Ages" (49). Maccoby then examines the Enlightenment, here focusing on the "painful question ... Why did antisemitism survive the Enlightenment?" (51). As in his section on Luther, Maccoby focuses on a central figure, Voltaire. He argues that Voltaire took the Christian antisemitic tradition and secularized it, using it in large part to attack Catholicism but, at the same time, retaining rather than overcoming 462</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews antisemitic attitudes. Maccoby reads Karl Marx as an example of Jewish self hatred and argues that, like Voltaire, Marx's attacks against Judaism are tied to those against Christianity. In Maccoby's view, Marx uses the former to attack the latter. Building from this historical overview, Maccoby then provides readings of three canonical authors, William Shakespeare, T. S. Eliot, and Ezra Pound. I found this second half of the book engrossing. Maccoby urges us to understand The Mer chant of Venice not merely as a dramatic instance of Jew baiting but as a drama with a theological message. He argues that Shakespeare bases his representation of Shylock on Puritans and Pharisees. This argument is controversial and provo cative and could potentially open up new and interesting discussions in the schol arship. Maccoby also reads Shylock as a manifestation of a Christian Oedipal complex. I find this reading less useful, but, of course, Maccoby's analysis of age and youth, father and daughter shine through his understanding of Shylock as a negative figure of the Old Law and Old Dispensation. This understanding is the kernel of his 1970 article, "The Delectable Daughter," which he reprises in this section. Maccoby's readings of T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound compare the two poets and their approaches to representations of Jews and Judaism. Both readings strive to reveal the roots of the Christian theological tradition in this modernist poetry, keeping with Maccoby's overall thesis. These chapters are shaped around a fascinating scholarly question: What is the relationship between aes thetics and antisemitism? How, Maccoby asks, can antisemitic sentiment be part of the production of what is recognized as literary excellence, and how are these two elements related in the Western tradition? This section does not ultimately provide any clear answers to this question, which has also been explored by other scholars, notably Anthony Julius. As with other parts of the book, however, Maccoby frames the issue in a fruitfully provocative way. More specific than this overarching question is Macco by's understanding of the differences between Eliot and Pound, an understanding that is ultimately more damning of Pound. According to Maccoby, Eliot saw something of himself in the Jews, who represent for him a type of original sin. Pound, in contrast, eschews this theological concept. In "losing" original sin, Maccoby argues, Pound also loses what Maccoby regards as a "safeguard" pro tecting the Jews. As in his interpretation of the impact of the Reformation on the development of antisemitism, Maccoby sees an abandonment of the safety valves of the Catholic tradition resulting in the murderous antisemitism that fueled Nazi genocide (123). Because this is a posthumous work, one can assume that, although Maccoby finished the manuscript, he was not able to complete extensive bibliographic refer ences if he had originally intended to do so. The lack of bibliographic detail is unfortunate. I think this book could inspire and challenge interested students, especially undergraduates, with its range, originality, and fervor. I would be reluctant to assign this book, though, without providing extensive textual and bib liographic references that would aid students in recognizing and understanding the controversial stands Maccoby often takes. And, even for those more familiar with 463</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews the field, the vast scope of the book ensures that almost any reader will need further bibliographic resources for some of the sections in order to weigh the analysis and to continue study. If the book is ever reissued, these needed aids should be provided. Lisa Lampert-Weissig University of California, San Diego San Diego, California</page></plain_text>
