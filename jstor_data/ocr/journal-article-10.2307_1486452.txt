I No student of Pirqei 'Avot or 'Avot de-Rabbi Natan (hereafter PA, ARN) can have failed to observe that the sayings of the Sages in the first chapter of PA and the sayings of the disciples of Yohanan ben Zakkail inside the second NOTE: I am grateful to the American Council of Learned Societies for the grant which made possible my study of the Pirqei 'A vot (PA) manuscripts at the Bodleian, and thus the preparation of the present paper. The 'Avot de-Rabbi Natan (ARN) edition referred to throughout the following pages is that by Solomon Schechter (Vienna, 1887; reprint ed. New York, 1945 and 1967). DS = Diqduqei soferim (talmudic variant readings), by Raphael Rabinowitz (New York, 1976). T plus a num- ber following it (e.g., T 20) refers to a Bodleian PA manuscript in the numbering of Charles Taylor in his Sayings of the Jewish Fathers (cf. n. 5, below). Whether the Pairs are historical or historicizations has no bearing on this paper; what is attributed to these teachers is what we are analyzing. 1. And perhaps also of Yohanan ben Zakkai himself, if we adopt the reading of his saying 41</page><page sequence="2">42 JUDAH GOLDIN chapter are transmitted in a style distinguished by threeness. Occasional seeming departures from this style have been plausibly explained by refer- ence to the readings of ARN or to variant manuscript readings.2 We may safely say, therefore, that the triadic character of all these sayings reflects stylization,3 resort to a particular rhetorical form for statements from the earliest spokesmen of the Oral Torah (the 'Anshei Keneset ha-Gedolah, ca. 250 B.c.) down through Yohanan ben Zakkai's best known disciples (at the end of the first and beginning of the second century A.D.), before and after the destruction of the Temple. (Even that catastrophe could not block the advance of the uninterrupted continuity of the oral tradition.) And if each of the sayings exhibits "three" clauses or phrases or items or other kinds of threefold, it may very well be that not three separate, independent, unrelated things, but one principal concern, formulated in the stylized man- ner is being underscored. Not always, of course. The Mishnah is perfectly capable of taking "three things" strictly and literally, as can be seen, for example, in M. BeiSah 2:8/'Eduyot 3:12, or 'Eduyot 2:5 or 2:7-8 or Shabbat 2:7 or in that long list of threes and classifications compiled in the twenty-fourth chapter of M. Kelim. But this does not eliminate the possibility that there are "three things" with a single law or objective in mind: note M. 'Eduyot 2:6. "Three things," in other words, in halakhic contexts are likely to mean three things literally; but the expression can also refer to three cases governed by one law, or to the thought that "the world is established by three things" (PA 1:18)-three terms whose aim is to emphasize one basic idea. Antigonus of Soko said (PA 1:3): "(a) Be not like slaves who serve their master for the sake in Version A Of ARN (p. 58), thus: "(a) If thou hast wrought much in thy study of Torah, take no credit for thyself, (b) for to this end wast thou created: (c) for men were created only on condi- tion that they study Torah." Contrast the reading in PA 2: 8, beginning. Note also Version B, pp. 58, 66. On 'asah torah, cf. Shraga Abramson, "Mi-leshon bakhamim," Leshonenu 19 (5714): 61ff. 2. Cf.

The last clause is what the first two were headed toward. "On three things the age [or, the world] stands" (PA 1:2): it is on three pillars that the particular age or the whole world rests. Judah ben Tabbai said (PA 1:8): "(a) Do not play the part of chief justice;5 (b) and when there are litigants standing before thee, look upon them as likely to be guilty; (c) but when they depart from thy presence, look upon them as likely to be innocent, as soon as they have accepted the sentence." Three clauses with one intention, to remind judges "on the bench" how to behave. II It should be noted that in the block of PA sayings to which we have referred, there occurs a change which deserves some attention. In the first three mishnayot of the first chapter of PA the exhortation or observation is either in the second person plural or in impersonal general terms. Thus, the 'Anshei Keneset ha-Gedolah say, Hevu (be), plural, ha'amidu (raise), 'asu (make); Antigonus says, 'Al tihyu (Be not), plural, 'ella hevu (but be), and let the fear of Heaven be upon you (plural, 'aleikhem). Simeon the Righ- teous spoke of the age or world (ha-'olam):6 a general statement, an observa- tion (doubtless with homiletical overtones). However, from the moment we come upon the sayings of the first Pair, everything is exhortation in second person singular (on 1:11, see below; I am unable to explain the exception in R. Joshua's "generalized" saying in 2:11). A shift from plural and general to second person singular, and a well-nigh consistent singular at that, must reflect something happening in the culture of a society, and I would like to put it this way: the first three PA sayings are addressed to (Jewish) society at 4. Cf. E. J. Bickerman, "The Maxim of Antigonus of Socho," Harvard Theological Review 44 (1951): 153-65. 5. For this translation, cf. Julius Theodor's note in Gen. R. 50:3, p. 519, to line 5; Charles Taylor, Sayings of the Jewish Fathers (New York, 1969), "Notes on the Text," p. 137; E. Y. Kutscher, Words and Their History (Hebrew, Jerusalem, 1961), pp. 90-91. With "accepting the sentence," contrast Adam's behavior, in Pesiqta Rabbati (ed. Meir Friedmann, Vienna, 1880), p. 26b (Resh Laqish), after sentence was passed.

The sayings may indeed be directed to a particular audi- ence at the outset, but that audience is regarded as representative of the whole community regardless of differentiations or affiliations. You, plural, do this or that. The fundamental pillars of this age or the world are the fol- lowing-a general statement addressed to all who might care to listen. But beginning with the first Pair, it is consistently thou, thee, thine, thy, as though one were talking not just to an audience at large but to members of one's own circle or profession or party, almost with an intimacy, with directness, with a message especially appropriate to those who share the speaker's convictions. This is how a master addresses his disciples or col- leagues. Thus, the plural of PA 1:11 is no exception. It is a direct warning to the bakhamim, the scholars: Beware of what you say, lest you and your disciples meet with disaster (and the name of Heaven be profaned). (Obviously we are not commenting here on the additional sayings of Hillel in chapter 1 or on the closing sayings of this chapter or on the "inter- ruption" in the first part of chapter 2 before 2:8.) In other words, if this is true, Yose ben Yoezer and Yose ben Yohanan may be the first (or be remembered or imagined as the first) leaders of the pharisaic party, quoted in this eminently pharisaic-rabbinic document, PA.7 It has been observed by other scholars also that in Antiquities 13.171ff., when Josephus introduces the three famous haireseis, he is in the midst of his account of affairs under Jonathan the high priest.8 The description of the sects follows immediately upon the report of the renewed treaties with Rome and Sparta (13.163-70) in 143 B.C.. Why Josephus should have inserted the passage on the sects at this point is not clear.9 Nevertheless, this does not allow us to say that the Pharisees came into being at that moment. But it does allow us to say that though inchoately groups were forming for about two or three decades before that, from about 170 B.C. on-when atti- tudes began to harden more and more because of the deteriorating behavior of hellenizers, the Syrian offensive against the Jewish religion, and the reverses and successes of the Maccabean wars-by the time of Jonathan, 7. Note the very beginning of PA 1:1 on the transmission of the oral plus the written Torah, as recognized by the commentators. 8. Cf. Emil Schiirer, Geschichte desjaidischen Volkes, 3rd ed., 2 vols.

At some time between approximately 165 and 130 B.C., the two Yoses served as leaders of the pharisaic hairesis. Thanks to PA and ARN we can recover, I believe, what these teachers-leaders were concerned with and urged upon their disciples-followers.12 Let us for the present consider the statements of the first Pair. III Yose ben Yoezer said: "(a) Let thy home be (yehi beitkha; Codex Kauf- mann: beitakh) a meeting-place (beit va'ad) for the Sages, (b) and be thou covered with the dust [stirred up] by their feet, (c) and thirstily do thou drink their words" (cf. Isa. 55:1).'3 Three clauses to one end. What is the theme? The kind of home a Pharisee ought to make, accord- ing to Yose ben Yoezer, for, as we shall see shortly, there is another view of the matter. The home of a Pharisee ought to be a beit va'ad for the men of bokhmah, the men of learning, the scholars, the teachers. Indeed, the host ought to regard himself as subservient to them, humbly thirsting for their words as they hold forth. A beit va'ad is an indoor locale where people are in the habit of assem- bling or meeting for some purpose. In our own age and circle we might say, "Let's meet at the Faculty Club," and a beit va'ad would be just that: people met at a spot which had been selected or had become known as a favorite meeting-place.14 And truly that is all, as we can tell from the comment in Mekhilta, Kaspa 4 (ed. J. Z. Lauterbach, 3 vols. [Philadelphia, 1933-35], 3:180), on the verse (Exod. 23:13), "'Make no mention of the names of 10. Cf. S. W.

Abba Bendavid, "'Al sifrei 'atiqot: Beit She'arim," Leshonenu la-'am 23 (5732): 248.</page><page sequence="6">46 JUDAH GOLDIN other gods."5 ... [This teaches] that you are not to make it [i.e., the place where the god is housed] into a beit va'ad," a place that serves as a [familiar] meeting place. Scholars however have a favorite meeting-place of their own, the beit midrash or ha-midrash (a term possibly in existence as early as the time of Sirach: Ecclus., ed. Segal, p. 358), the academy. Since for the Sages no get- ting-together for any purpose is as significant as a gathering together for the study of Torah, when they want to refer to their meeting-place, they speak of it as the meeting-place, beit ha-va'ad; and this reading (for scholars' meet- ing-place) is consistent in our sources despite the reading that appears on occasion in our printed texts as well as in the Kaufmann Codex of the Mish- nah (Sotah 9:15/23). The evidence is presented in the note at this point.16 It is even possible that the more frequent beit ha-va'ad derives ultimately from Yose ben Yoezer's having spoken of a beit va'ad for the bakhamim, beit va'ad, not yet beit ha-va'ad. Besides, "beit ha-va'ad for the bakhamim" might almost seem redundant. What kind of home should a disciple of Pharisees create? According to Yose ben Yoezer it should be a place where as a rule scholars congregate; or, as ARN says, "A person's home ought to be ready to receive the Sages and 15.

Judah ben Batyra). The reading of M. Sotah 9:15 = B. T. Sotah 49b, beit va'ad, should be beit ha-va'ad as in Haggadoth hatalmud, p. 80a; note also Massekhet Derekh 'Eres, ed. Michael Higger (New York, 1935), p. 244. Sotah 9:131 and Sanhedrin 11:165 of Jacob ibn Habib, 'Ein Ya'aqov (New York, 1955) also read beit ha-va'ad. T. Megillah 3(4):5, ed. Saul Lieberman, p. 354, similarly, beit ha-va'ad (and note also Tosefta Ki-Fshutah, pp. 1168-69). On the reading meqom ha-va'ad in B.T. Sanhedrin 31b, cf. DS ad loc. (that the MS reading is le-veit ha-va'ad). The reading meqom ha-va'ad in M. Rosh ha-Shanah 4:4 occurs also in Codex Kaufmann, MSS Parma and Paris, and ed. W. H. Lowe (Cambridge, 1883); in ed. Naples the whole statement of R. Joshua ben Qorhah is omitted, but is quoted immediately (li-meqom ha-va'ad) in the commentary which follows. See further J. N. Epstein, Mavo le-nusab ha-Mishnah (Jerusalem, 5708), pp. 488-89. On beit ha-va'ad and beit ha-midrash, cf. Louis Ginzberg, Commentary on the Palestinian Talmud (Hebrew), 4 vols.

""7 The home Yose ben Yoezer is advocating is a place where Sages, disciples, and disciples of disciples con- gregate, in other words, a well-known "salon" for the intellectual el1ite. They all (= of all grades, but all identified as the intellectuals) know where to go. IV If it were not for the statement of his colleague, Yose ben Yohanan, per- haps this would not stand out so clearly. The latter, Yose ben Yohanan, is also describing an ideal home to his disciples-followers, yehi beitkha (Codex Kaufmann: beitakh), "Let thy home be," but something else is uppermost in his mind. Once again there will be three clauses to one end, in second person singular. "(a) Let thy home be wide open, (b) and let the poor ('aniyyim) be members of thy household, (c) and talk not overmuch with ha-'ishah."'1 And that is all. This is how ARN, p. 33, reads and how PA read originally; but before we analyze this saying, we must note that PA 1:5, as it already reads in the Kaufmann Codex, continues after "ha-'ishah" as follows: "[One is not to talk overmuch] with his own wife, they (the Sages) said,"9 all the more then with another's wife.20 Hence the Sages said: So long as a man talks over- much with ha-'ishah,2' he brings evil upon himself, neglects the study of Torah, and in the end what he inherits is Gehenna."

The addition in Codex Kaufmann of "when his wife is niddah, menstruant," although followed by several authorities, is not to be adopted (cf. S. Schechter in his Introduction to ARN pp. xvii-xx, and Appendix 4). That reading is itself an attempt to make sense out of the third clause of ben Yohanan's saying. (The reading be-'ishto niddah is reported as a Rashi or French version. Is it possible that this reading, an attempt at softening the impact and brusqueness of the accepted reading, is due partly to fears of heresy? Avoiding overmuch talk with one's wife even when she is not niddah, might well lead to more and more withdrawal from his wife. In the first half of the eleventh cen- tury in Christian France and then again in the twelfth century, attacks on traditional mar- riage-Bogomilism, Catharism-were a real danger to the Established Church; and perhaps beyond the Church too a threat or influence was felt. This suggestion is tentative of course, for the subject requires thorough investigation by a medievalist.)</page><page sequence="8">48 JUDAH GOLDIN refers to one's own wife (note the third person!), that one is not to talk overmuch with her, and then further commentary on the preceding com- ment, why such conversation is fatal22-is already departure from the recur- ring manner of speaking of the PA sayings of the early Sages. This is strik- ingly preserved in ARN version A (p. 35) where the whole passage "even with one's own wife, all the more . .. another's wife" and so on to "what he inherits is Gehenna," is actually presented as commentary23 on Yose ben Yohanan's third clause, not as part of the Mishnah text. The commentary itself requires examination before we return to Yose's own saying, Talk not overmuch with ha-'ishah. If this were a reference to women in general, what is the meaning of "overmuch"? What business has a man holding conversations at all with women other than his wife? In late tannaite times, the Babylonian R. Aha(i) ben R. Josiah was to say that anyone who keeps staring at women will in the end fall into the transgres- sion (of adultery).24 According to the Sages, to stare at a woman's heel is to bring on a calamitous decree, defective children.25 Conversations with women lead to whoring.26 True, these statements do not come from as early a period as that of the first Pair. Nor are they always Palestinian. But the view they reflect is as early as Sirach (ca. 200-180 B.C.): Do not look upon anyone" for beauty, And do not sit in the midst of women; 22. Note threeness in the rhetoric here too: "(a) he brings evil upon himself, (b) neglects the study of Torah, and (c) in the end what he inherits is Gehenna." 23. Note the way Version A, p. 35, puts it: "'And talk not overmuch with ha-'ishah': even with his own wife, and needless to say with his fellow's wife! For so long as a man talks over- much with ha-'ishah, he brings evil ...," etc. No word of "they [the Sages] said," or, "hence the Sages said."

Better is the wickedness of a man than a woman who does good; and it is a woman who brings shame and disgrace.28 Do not look intently at a virgin,29 lest you stumble and incur penalties for her ... Do not look around in the streets of a city, nor wander about in its deserted sections. Turn away your eyes from a shapely woman, and do not look intently at beauty belonging to another; many have been misled by a woman's beauty, and by it passion is kindled like a fire. Never dine alone with another man's wife, nor revel with her at wine; lest your heart turn aside to her, and .. . you be plunged into destruction.30 The first interpretation of "talk not overmuch with ha-'ishah" is con- sequently correct, that it is a reference to one's own wife31 (all the more, then, to someone else's wife). And therefore Yose ben Yohanan deliberately says, "Talk not overmuch with ha-'ishah, the wife," and not, "Talk not with thy wife"-that would be preposterous, not virtuous. Once this early pharisaic teaching becomes a popular saying, it may cease to be restricted to its original intention and will be generalized-if one wishes to be witty or sarcastic. Thus,32 when R. Yose the Galilean (but cf. DS and note ad locum) asked R. Meir's wife for directions to Lydda and used too many words, she could reprimand him, One must not talk overmuch with ha-'ishah, with a woman; it's enough to say, "How to Lydda?"

Here a new motif has been introduced, neglecting the study of Torah and its terrible consequences.33 But the single thought of Yose ben Yohanan, as we shall see, is of something else. Why this ambiguity, however, whether one should avoid long conversa- tions with one's wife or with women, that is, why should it even be necessary to spell out that ha-'ishah in our mishnah equals "his own wife"? The answer is, the ambiguity is not in what Yose ben Yohanan said; it is in the word 'ishah, which means "woman" but also "wife," and only context dis- closes the precise meaning (and sometimes does not). It would be going too far away from the evidence to say that only ha-'ishah is used when "wife" is intended. A few examples: In M. Yoma 1:1 R. Judah says that a week before Atonement Day, among other arrangements made for the high priest, another wife, 'ishah (woman?-but ha-'ishah ha-'aberet would be clumsy and misleading) is prepared lest his wife ('ishto) die. Better: M. Gittin 3:1: a bill of divorcement not written specifically in name of the wife ('ishah). Or, M. Yevamot 6:6-If a man was married to a woman ('ishah = wife) for ten years and she bore no children. M. Nedarim 10:6, a wife ('ishah) he himself acquired, a wife ('ishah) whom Heaven has led him to acquire. There are other examples (e.g., PA 5:5, "No 'ishah ever miscarried ..."), a number possibly even more striking than these. On the other hand, ha-'ishah, the 'ishah, is again and again favored as expression for "wife." Ha-'ishah can be interpreted as "woman" (cf., e.g., M. Rosh ha-Shanah 1:8; M. Sanhedrin 6:4, "The Sages say, You hang a man, not a woman, ha-'ishah)," even as 'ishah can refer to a wife, as we just observed. But at least in the Mishnah many of the ha-'ishah instances seem to refer to women in marriage. For example (to choose from well known mishnayot), M. Yevamot 15:1, "husband and wife who went overseas" (lit., ha-'ishah, wife ... and her husband); Qiddushin 1:1, "a wife is acquired (ha-'ishah niqneit");34 2:1, "the 'ishah is betrothed"; 'Eduyot 8:5, "R. Aqiba reported ... that ha-'ishah may be remarried on the testimony of one wit- ness [that the husband has died]." This is not intended as a statistical summary of word frequency, or any- thing like that-which cannot even be arrived at by means of a concordance alone (useful, of course, as that is!): note, for example, when C. Y. Kasovsky in the Mishnah Concordance vocalizes be-'ishah and H. Yalon (in the 33. Cf. above n. 23. 34. Cf. D. H. Weiss, "The Use of m3i in Connection with Marriage," Harvard Theological Review, 57(1964): 244ff.</page><page sequence="11">THE HOME OF A PHARISEE 51 Mishnah, ed. Albeck-Yalon) vocalizes ba-'ishah (Ketubbot 8:1, bis; Hullin 4:7; Parah 5:4; Miqva'ot 9:2; Niddah 2:5, 6; 5:7; Nega'im 6:7; Zavim 2:1; Bekhorot 3:1). There are similar disagreements between them in connection with le-'ishah and la-'ishah.35 Ha-'ishah, then, that is, 'ishah with the definite article, does often refer to "wife"; and in our particular Mishnah, PA 1:5, that meaning is insisted on, made explicit, rightly as we have seen, by the first part of that early com- ment. V "Yehi beitkha, let thy home be," Yose ben Yohanan also, like his col- league, had begun his sentence. He too, in other words, seeks to teach his disciples what one's home ought to be like. Unlike his colleague, however, he underscores that a home ought to be inviting not only to the 61ite, to the scholars; on the contrary, let thy home be wide open, in other words, open to all. Hospitality is extended even to nonscholars,36 to any who seek to enter, even to the poor, but not exclusively to them. We will return to the poor shortly. Probably everyone devoted to improvement of human conduct has at one time or another beseeched his audience to practice charity.37 Yose ben 35. Yevamot 14:1; Ketubbot 5:2; Sotah 3:8-note Codex Kaufmann; Gittin 8:8, bis; Qid- dushin 2:1, 3:1, 2, 5, 6, 10; Bava Batra 3:3 (context supports Yalon); 10:1 (ditto); 10:7 (ditto); Horayot 1:7, bis; 'Arakhin 6:2, Keritot 2:4. In these Yalon reads la-'ishah, while Kasovsky reads le-'ishah. On calling attention to the significance of the definite article in "related" nouns, cf. Tosefot Yom Tov ad M. Ketubbot 1:1, s.v. "betulah." And in the commentary of R. Joseph ibn Shoshan-fourteenth cent.; cf. Jewish Encyclopaedia, s.v. "Ibn Shushan"--Bodleian MS Mich. 265, [Neubauer 385], fol. 44v) there is explicit emphasis that ha-'ishah, because of the definite article, refers to wife, "for if reference is to other women, what sense does overmuch make?" 36. Note the high praise for "entertaining guests" by a number of Amoraim in B. T. Shabbat 127a (and in name of R. Yohanan, enlargement of M. Pe'ah 1:1; cf. Seligmann Baer, Seder 'Avodat Yisra'el [Redelheim, 1868], pp. 38-39). 37. Even cynics and Bernard Shaw do not advocate cruelty, though they may quarrel with the popular notion of what constitutes charity. Plutarch Moralia 235E ("Sayings of Spartans," 56), quotes the following: "A beggar (epaitis) asked alms of a Spartan, who said, 'If I should give to you, you will be the more a beggar (mallon ptOcheuseis); and for this unseemly conduct of yours he who first gave to you is responsible, for he thus made you lazy.' " (See also Artemi- dorus Oneirocritica 3.53 [trans. R. S. White, (Park Ridge, New Jersey, 1975), pp. 171-72].) And yet (235F, 60), "Only in Sparta does it pay to grow old"! Respect or reverence for the old has nothing to do with charity, of course. But at least it reveals the possibility of civilized atten- tion to others existing without the presence of compassion for the unfortunate.</page><page sequence="12">52 JUDAH GOLDIN Yohanan is no exception (cf. Isa. 58:7), but he has something more inclusive in mind, particularly since in his time (the same is doubtless true of other times) there were those who might take exception to his point of view. Sirach (Ecclus. 11:29, 34) says: "Do not bring every man into your home, for many are the wiles of the crafty." ... Receive a stranger (allotrion) into your home and he will upset (diastrepsei) you with commotion (tarachais), and will estrange you from your family (t6n idiun sou)." Yose ben Yohanan on the contrary says, "Let thy home be wide open," rather than open only to a favorite group, or rather than shut to strangers. In its commentary on the clause "Let thy home be wide open," ARN (in both versions, p. 33) applies the teaching to treatment of the poor. "This teaches that a man's house should be wide open to the north, south, east and west, like Job's, who made four doorways to his house.39 And why did Job make four doorways to his house? So that the poor would not be troubled to go all around the house [seeking the entrance]: one coming from the north could enter in his stride, one coming from the south could enter in his stride, and so in all directions. For that reason Job made four doorways to his house."40 Though picturesque, this is not an unreasonable interpretation, that is, that Yose ben Yohanan is eager to emphasize that a person's home should in every way welcome the poor.4' That ben Yohanan has the poor in mind, one might argue, can be seen in his second clause, "and let the poor be members of thy household, ve-yihyu 'aniyyim benei beitekha." 38. Cf. B. T. Yevamot 63b and B. T. Sanhedrin 100b (see Ben Sira, ed. Segal, p. 75, on what he numbers 11:36), and note that in Sanhedrin this view is said to be the view of Rabbi (Judah the Prince) also! In The New Yorker, July 23, 1979, p. 37, Ved Mehta reports his father quoting the following Punjabi saying to his mother: Those who have not been born of your blood Come into your house And separate the real blood brothers. 39. The prooftext is provided by Version B of ARN (p. 33), Job 31:32, "My doors [dity, i.e., delatai] I opened to the wayfarer." My former student, Mary Rose D'Angelo, once observed that there was also a play on words here, dlt (dalet) = 4 and dlt (delet) = door. In several MSS at the Bodleian (Mich. 507 [ol. 665], fol. 4r; see also T 25 [5b] and T 26) the commentary adds that the poor may be enabled to enter in one door and go out another, so that those standing by the entrance may not see him leave, to his embarrassment. See also ARN, p. 138, line 14 from bottom. 40. Cf. L. Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews, 7 vols. (Philadelphia, 1909-38), 5:248, n. 223. 41. Note also Tobit 2:2 (or 4:7ff.), dated fourth century B.c. by E. J. Bickerman, Studies in Jewish and Christian History, 2 vols. (Leiden, 1976), 1:55.</page><page sequence="13">THE HOME OF A PHARISEE 53 Nevertheless, the way the two versions of ARN proceed to interpret the latter clause suggests that something like a retreat from such understanding of that second clause is being recommended by them. For on the second clause of that saying which speaks of the 'aniyyim becoming part of one's menage, both versions immediately enter their respective reservations. Version A declares that the 'aniyyim, the poor, are not actually to be "members of thy household," and Version B declares that the term 'aniyyim in that sentence is not a reference to the "poor," but to the duty of the members of the household to be humble and soft-spoken, 'anavim,42 "let the members of thy household be humble." If therefore the second clause refers in some fashion to 'aniyyim, it is not simply repeating what the first clause urged. Both versions of ARN are at one in this. The first clause may well have the poor in mind in some sense-if a home is to be open to all without distinction, a word about the poor (the world's most uninvited generally) is certainly not out of place. If the poor are not to be members of my household actually, let them be so treated as to keep them talking of the generosity of my hospitality; if the members of my household are not actually to be poor but humble, then the poor arriving at my door must and will be received decently. But nothing compels us to assume that the second clause is no more than a repetition of the thought of the first clause: even ARN, in its understanding, tries to distinguish somehow between the two, as we have just noted. On the contrary, the first is a plea to open one's door to all ("Let thy home be wide open"), without distinctions; that is all it says. And the second is a special 42. See BDB on 'nw and 'ny (pp. 776-77). On Version A of ARN also undertaking interpreta- tion of 'nw, cf. ibid., p. 34. Of course, I am not denying that bny bytk (bnei beitekha, on which cf. E. Y. Kutscher, Hebrew and Aramaic Studies [Jerusalem, 1977], p. 92 [of Hebrew part]) has the meaning of "servants, stewards," as both PA commentators (e.g., Vitry, Maimonides, etc.) and modern scholars say (e.g., E. Z. Melamed, "Li-leshonah shel massekhet 'Avot," Leshonenu 20 [5716]: 110-11; H. L. Ginsberg, Koheleth [Hebrew, Tel Aviv-Jerusalem, 1961], p. 68; W. F. Albright, "Abram the Hebrew: A New Archaeological Interpretation," Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, no. 163 [October 1961], p. 47 and nn. 54-56). Note how the amora Raba quotes the saying in B. T. Bava MeSi'a 60b. But that need not always be the case: note the expression in the context of Version A Of ARN, pp. 34-35 (top). On benei beito = his wife, cf. S. Lieberman, Tosefta Ki-Fshutah, Pesabim, p. 627, lines 48-49. In his Commentary to the Mishna Shabbat (Jerusalem, 1976, p. 384), Abraham Goldberg notes the meaning "guests." For the expression brbyy, see Lev. R. 25:8, p. 584, line 5 and note, ad loc. and cf. S. Lieberman, ad loc., pp. 877-78. See further E. Y. Kutscher in Franz Rosenthal, ed., An Aramaic Handbook, 2 vols.

Conversation with one's wife reflects what is going on inside the home.44 The question is, what specifically does Yose ben Yohanan have in mind when he adds this statement to the preceding two? One answer we have already met above, that talking and talking with a wife interferes with the study of Torah (and Gehenna is inherited as a result). But such interference is surmountable: let a man escape to where he cannot be dis- turbed or distracted (cf. ARN, chap. 21, p. 74, "the conversation of children," and the reading in Schechter's note 10), and not come home till his studies exhaust him. (Cf. B.T. Sanhedrin 26b, R. Hanan/Yohanan: Ds ad locum; Maimonides, Code, "Nashim, 'Ishut" 14:1.) And maybe this is implied by the sages of the exhortation closing PA 1:5, but they do not say it. In any event, this warning against long conversation because it interferes with Torah study-although it occurs in our printed and manuscript Mishnah texts-is not, however, what Yose ben Yohanan said, but what Version A (not Version B!) of ARN says. There is no mention of Sages or disciples or study or academy or Torah in Yose ben Yohanan's own saying. What is more, the explanatory reflection on neglecting to study Torah may even have come into being from an effort to harmonize the teaching of the latter Yose with the teaching of the former Yose.45 Trying to make sense out of that saying, Mahbzor Vitry (ed. Simeon Hur- witz [Niirnberg, 1923], p. 468), rightly rejecting the reading be-'ishto niddah, 43. Version a of ARN, p. 33. Like master like dog! (Beasts belonging to saints, saintly like their masters: Version A Of ARN, p. 38.) On opening the doors to rich and poor alike, cf. Samuel ben Isaac Uceda, Midrash Shemuel, p. 17, nine lines from bottom. 44. Note also the expression in M. Yoma 1:1, beito zo 'ishto (his house-home = his wife). See also R. Yose in B. T. Shabbat 1 18b (toward bottom). A scholar (talmid hakham) should not be conversing with any woman (even his wife, his daughter, his sister) out of doors: B. T. Berakhot 43b, bottom; and cf. DS ad loc. (This does not appear in Derekh 'EreS, ed. Higger, p. 116.) "Scholaris, qui loquitur cum puella, non praesumitur dicere Pater Noster" (Adriaan Beverland, 1654?-1712, The Law Concerning Draped Virginity [Paris, 1905], pp. 132-33 quoting Baldo). 45. That such attempts at harmonization occur, can be seen in ARNB, second paragraph, p. 28, on "Let thy home be a meeting-place for the Sages," compared with ARNA, p. 33, lines 2 and 3 of the comment on "And let the poor be members of thy household." Note a scribal lapse in MS Bodleian Opp. 245 (ol. 422) (Neubauer 390), fol. 21v, "Let thy home be wide open, a meet- ng-place for the Sages!"</page><page sequence="15">THE HOME OF A PHARISEE 55 says that talking overmuch with one's wife, "idle chatter," leads to frivolity and sexual desire. Maimonides proceeds along similar lines: "It is well known that for the most part conversation with women has to do with sexual matters." But if these had been Yose ben Yohanan's concerns, it is difficult to see a connection between the first two clauses and the third. Open thy house to all, let the poor enjoy thy hospitality (or, let the members of thy household be modest toward the poor); and don't converse at length with thy wife. This sounds dissonant. If one begins with thoughts about hospitality to others, does that lead him to talk about making or not making love to his wife? Little wonder that Samuel ben Isaac Uceda (Midrash Shemuel, p. 18) is led to the "possible" suggestion (ve-'efshar ii lomar) that a man might refrain from inviting guests to his house because (a) he wishes to spend as much time as possible with his wife alone, or (b) he suspects that the guests might be attracted by his wife! Rabbi Samuel's hunch is right. There should be a connection between the three clauses. But surely there is still another possible thought, less farfetched in my opinion, accompanying the theme of the hospitable home, to demonstrate that the three clauses belong together. The classical host of Scripture-and in their discussion of Yose ben Yohanan's saying, both versions of ARN refer to him-is Abraham.46 He is eager to entertain the three men who appear in the heat of the day. A little water, a morsel of bread, he says to them. But he hurries (va-yemaher) into the tent and says to his wife, "Quick now (mahari), three measures of choice flour!" (One measure per guest?) "Knead and make cakes!" Not another word. Then he runs to see to it that more is prepared, and the attending ser- vant also hurries (va-yemaher). Swiftness is of the essence. When it comes to 46. ARN speaks of Abraham's hospitality to all, and how he surpassed Job in hospitality: how he ran forth looking for guests; how he served them with dishes they never before tasted (could not afford)! The midrash on Abraham's entertaining the three wayfarers (Gen. 18:1 ff.) is in Mekhilta, 'Amaleq 3 (ed. Lauterbach, 2:178 and parallels). The indefatigable emphasis on charity and hospitality in Judaism (and later, Christianity too) in Greco-Roman centuries, is not just relief of the poor for reasons of policy or politics, or quid pro quo beneficence. (The phenomenon of public gifts to the state, or polis or even some collegia to establish funds and foundations, etc., is an entirely different subject; see A. R. Hands, Charities and Social Aid in Greece and Rome [London, 1968]. See especially his Chapter 5 on the poor.) Emphasis obviously reflects the need to emphasize, that people may not be responding spontaneously as they should. Nevertheless, the tireless rhetoric reveals what has become a fixed value within a moral "system." In this, even a scholar may have to be'taught a lesson or two: Lev. R. 9:3, pp. 176ff. Cf. n. 54 below.</page><page sequence="16">56 JUDAH GOLDIN entertaining strangers, the command to Sarah is brief, even peremptory, and he hastens to provide the rest.47 This, it seems to me, is what Yose ben Yohanan has in mind: as in the case of that model host, Abraham, let all who come thy way be welcome; as for the poor, entertain them properly, well; and with the lady of the house, let thy speech be brief and to the point: quick, prepare the food. That is what beitkha, thy home, should be like. VI From the sayings of the two Yoses, the first of the five Pairs, we learn what the early pharisaic masters in the first half of the second century B.C. were concerned with: yehi beitkha, let thy home be of a certain character. For Yose ben Yoezer it should be a place where the savants are in the habit of assembling. That the wife might have a role in the home, he does not even mention-because that is irrelevant to his chief preoccupation. What his attitude was regarding hospitality to the poor, we do not know, for he has not told us. But evidently he did feel strongly about instructing his students and followers that the proper home is a place which the intellectual elite fre- quent. The voice is the voice of the aristocracy of learning. Let hoi polloi keep out. (And in his commentary ad locum, R. Jonah Gerondi [thirteenth cent.] insists that scholars would assemble only in the house of the distin- guished, not just any house!) As to Yose ben Yohanan, he seems to be protesting against this view. But even if he is ignoring it, or is unaware (?) of it, his attitude is, Thy home is to be open to all, even to the poor of course-but whoever the guest, from far or near, poor or otherwise, receive him as Father Abraham received the three travelers (who in his eyes were no more than wandering Bedouins, idol worshippers).48 The proper household welcomes everyone, not only the scholars. The poor, the not-poor too, should be treated hospitably; and be 47. This view is perhaps in the back of the mind of Joseph ibn Shoshan (n. 35 above): u-vi-qesarah (the husband is to speak briefly). In Version B of ARN, p. 126, one view has it that women are lazy (dawdlers) and the prooftext offered is that of Abraham ordering Sarah, "Quick now, three measures" (etc.). Note how in B. T. Bava MeSi'a 87a the Abraham-order to Sarah of Gen. 18 is interpreted as support for the view that women are less generous than men (cf. Sifrei Num. 110, p. 115), and this is referred to by Samuel ben Isaac Uceda, Midrash Shemuel, p. 18, lines 12ff. But this is not what I am driving at. 48. Cf. the Mekhilta reference in n. 46, above.</page><page sequence="17">THE HOME OF A PHARISEE 57 brief (rather than long-winded) in instructing the lady of the house to serve the company. Once the original meaning was forgotten,49 other explanations were bound to appear. A favorite one for PA (so preoccupied with study of Torah in many of its sayings: 2:2, 7, 8a [beginning], 12, 16; 3:2b, 3, 6, 7b, 8, 9, 17, 18; 4:5, 10, 13, 14, 20; 5:12, 15 [and practically the whole of the supplemen- tary sixth chapter]), would almost certainly be in terms of admonishment against behavior that might lead to neglect or slackening of Torah study. Therefore, one should not talk overmuch with his wife: it diverts from study. But as ARN reveals in both versions (pp. 34-35), still other interpretations are possible (although some readings remain unclear). Note well: no longer mention of neglecting Torah study and inheriting Gehenna! Version A sug- gests that if at the academy one has fallen out with a colleague, or has not been shown proper respect, he is not to go and tell his wife; the end of such tale telling is a disgrace to all concerned and leads to his being held in con- tempt by his wife. Version B warns a man not to brag to his wife of the honors he has enjoyed at the academy: it comes to no good (he ceases to make the effort to improve, grows self-satisfied?). Or, not to tell his wife of quarrels he has had with someone else: before you know it, everyone is involved in insults and mutual recriminations, even passersby. Or (apparent- ly: the text is euphemistic and mutilated), to beware lest his wife become a hussy and the man be disgraced.5" Or, to learn a lesson from Samson who 49. Cf. J. Goldin, "Of Change and Adaptation in Judaism," History of Religions 4 (1965): 282-83, 285-86. 50. The following is a tentative translation and interpretation of the passage: "Another interpretation of 'Do not talk overmuch with the wife': [for] he brings disgrace on himself. How so? In the first week [of their married life?], she comes to where he is. [Sub- sequently,?] when she hears him coming into the courtyard, she goes into a room [and] from the room into the triclinium [i.e., a room with the couches for dining, in the interior: cf. the imagery - PA 4:16]. He follows after her, and in his presence she "uncovers" her head and he enters into long conversation with her. What caused him to disgrace himself? His having entered into long conversation with her." Cf. also the translation and interpretation by Anthony Saldarini, The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan, Version B (Leiden, 1975), p. 110. Something like a man's losing face seems to be involved here-at first the husband plays the dominant role, but by prolonging conversation with his wife, the text implies (or seems to imply), that she gets the upper hand and he has to beg for her favors. A woman, of course, is not to "uncover" (cf. The Torah [Philadelphia, 1962], Lev. 10:6, note) her head in public (cf. M. Ketubbot 7:6; M. Bava Qamma 8:6; see also Samuel Krauss, Talmudische Archdologie, 2 vols. [Leipzig, 1910], 1:651, n. 874, and Qadmoniyyot ha-Talmud, 2 vols. [Tel-Aviv, 1945], vol. 2, pt. 2, 274-78); but the expression here seems to suggest that she is brazen in her demands on her husband (not waiting for him to make the proper overtures or forcing him to sue at length). Unfortunately, several specific points are still unclear to me. Going from room to room and the</page><page sequence="18">58 JUDAH GOLDIN met with disaster because he talked too much to his wife. All these explana- tions have this in common: they are no longer aware of the original meaning of Yose ben Yohanan's saying, and are groping for an answer to the ques- tion, Why should not a man talk at length with his own wife? VII I am unable to locate anything in Hellenistic literature which corre- sponds to this "Let thy home be," although it may be hiding somewhere,51 and although even if it did or does exist, it would in no way diminish the sig- nificance of the teachings of our two Sages. Xenophon's Oeconomicus is not only of an earlier period, but is concerned with an altogether different theme: How to break the old (young) girl in! He also is not prepared to hold long conversations with his wife, the general rule with Athenians at least in the Classical Period.52 The attitude of the pharisaic Sages and later of most Tannaim and Amoraim is very likely not radically different. (The second person singular in PA is masculine; it is the man one addresses. But this is probably merely stylistic, even as it is in our speech. Until one gets accus- tomed to it, "chairperson" sounds prim, and Hebrew has no neuter.) Like Thales or Socrates who could be grateful to Fortune for being born a man husband following after her, may also be part of the humiliation he is subjected to, and long conversation may refer to the husband's entreating. 51. And yet, cf. Semonides (seventh cent. B.C. as translated by M. Arthur in S. B. Pomeroy (Goddesses, Whores, Wives, Slaves [New York, 1975]), p.52, lines 3-4: "For whosever wife she is, she won't receive graciously//Into the house a friend who comes to visit." (In the Oxford Book of Greek Verse, chosen by Gilbert Murray et al. [Oxford, 1954], pp. 161ff., these lines are not included.) 52. Cf. above, n. 18; and cf. C. Taylor, Sayings, 1:140, top. Note also W. K. Lacey, The Family in Classical Greece (Ithaca, 1968), pp. 158 (bottom)ff., 167ff. See also Pomeroy, God- desses, p. 74. Though he speaks of the Roman woman ("The Silent Women of Rome"), Sir M. I. Finley's essay in his Aspects of Antiquity ([London, 1977], pp. 124ff.) is instructive also for our subject. In The New Yorker, loc. cit. (n. 38 above), Ved Mehta quotes a Punjabi quatrain his father recited to his mother: Yours is a life without help, The same is your story: Milk under your veil, Always water in your eyes. A suggestion has been made to me orally that entertaining in the ordinary Greek home was unlikely because Greek houses were small. But surely ordinary houses in Judea and Jewish Palestine were hardly more spacious than their Greek counterparts.</page><page sequence="19">THE HOME OF A PHARISEE 59 and not a woman (Diogenes Laertius 1:33), a Jew could thank God that He had not made him a woman.53 But this is not the immediate concern of Yose ben Yohanan. In her studies of "women in classical antiquity," S. B. Pomeroy has pointed out that in Hellenistic times, "The legal and economic responsibili- ties of [wealthy and aristocratic women] increased, but political gains were more illusory" (p. 125). She goes on (p. 130): "Not only in Egypt but in other areas of the Greek world respectable women were participating more actively in economic affairs." (Not so in Athens.) Nevertheless, Peripatetic philosophers "theorized that more education would turn women into rather lazy, talkative busybodies (cf. R. Eliezer in M. Solah 3:4 and Albeck, p. 383). Even the upper class, to which one would naturally look for an endorsement of schooling for women, did not educate its daughters" (p. 131). And in a Neopythagorean text quoted by Professor Pomeroy (p. 135), we read, "A woman must live for her husband ... thinking no private thoughts of her own ... must bear all that her husband bears.. ." and more of the same. There are sentences in this short treatise that do reflect hus- band-wife relations in the home, but basically it is the woman's conduct that author is ordering (the injunctions are addressed to her), not formulating what a home should be. There is, needless to say, such a thing as entertaining friends, and when possible many friends, even lavishly when the occasion calls for it. There is furthermore benefaction, setting up funds for the benefit of fellow citizens and for the acquisition of a reputation as a generous and public-spirited person, as a philanthropist. But this subject is different from ours.54 Rostovtzev55 is right to insist that even in Hellenistic times the Greek continued to be a homo politicus ("especially in the mother country"); he too however acknowledges the growing emphasis on individualism, especially 53. T. Berakhot 6(7):18, ed. Saul Lieberman, p. 38; see also Tosefta Ki-Fshutah, p. 120, and now also Naphtali Wieder, "'Al ha-berakhot 'goy, 'eved, 'ishah,' 'behemah,' 'u-vur,' " Sinai 85 (1979): 97-118. 54. As we said above, n. 46, second paragraph (see also n. 55, end). See especially Hands, Charities, chaps. 3-6. Here may well lie the crucial difference between pharisaic charity and Hellenistic (-Roman): in the former, all sorts of persons are to be invited in; cf. Version B of ARN, p. 34. 55. M. I. Rostovtzev, Social and Economic History of the Hellenistic World, 2 vols. (Oxford, 1964), 2:1118-21 (I owe this reference to Professor J. Frank Gilliam). For a picture of domestic felicity by a first century A.D. Stoic, cf. C. E. Lutz, "Musonius Rufus," in Yale Classical Studies 10 (1947): 96-101; but still no word about inviting others to share with family. We are not talk- ing of inviting friends, but of others = strangers, anyone in need.</page><page sequence="20">60 JUDAH GOLDIN by the "dogmatic philosophies of conduct." These could provide the in- dividual with guidance for family life56 among other necessary relations. But a specific prescription for the ideal character of the individual home is still wanting. What was there in Judea of the first half of the second century B.C. which prompted leading pharisaic sages to encourage their disciples to create a particular kind of home life which included entertainment of others as well, scholars, or scholars and nonscholars too? To my knowledge, nothing rele- vant appears thus far in the literature of the Dead Sea Scrolls (and that includes the Temple Scroll).57 I have only guesses, and none of them satis- factory, because they are no more than guesses. Perhaps this concern with the Jewish home is a byproduct of the diffused individualism of the Hellenis- tic world at large. Perhaps it is a reaction against the spreading hellenization of upper social classes among the Jews in pre-Maccabean and Hasmonean times: not from such is the pharisaic Jew to choose his example of the proper home (note also Version A Of ARN, p. 26; Josephus Antiquities 18.12). Per- haps it is anti-Sadducean-welcome bakhamim, the scholars devoted to the Oral Torah; or, all men (unlike Sadducees who "even among themselves [are] rather boorish in their behavior, and in their intercourse with their peers are as rude as to aliens")."5 Perhaps it is meant to discourage too active participation in public life and instead to encourage one to cultivate his private, moral life59 where he can or might accomplish what he under- takes to do. Be the reason or the combination of reasons what it may, the sayings of the two Yoses reveal what early pharisaic leaders have set their minds on, the home the Pharisee is to make for himself; and already at the outset we can detect what was to be true later too of the successors of the Pharisees, the Rabbis; that is, agreement on the fundamental but different interpreta- tions thereof. Both Yoses insist that the private home is of great importance, 56. See also Plutarch Moralia 769 ("A Dialogue on Love," pp. 23-24). 57. Nevertheless, see Damascus Covenant 6:21, but see also Louis Ginzberg, An Unknown Jewish Sect (New York, 1976), p. 202.

And note the variety of explanations of why one should "love work," in Version A, pp. 44-45.</page><page sequence="21">THE HOME OF A PHARISEE 61 but one believes that it is to be a center for scholars, the new and emerging intellectual aristocracy; while to the other such exclusiveness is unsatisfac- tory, for to him hospitality-the unrestricted reaching out to the members of society-is what will make for the proper kind of host and modesty, unit- ing rich and poor, scholar and nonscholar (Pharisees and affiliates of other sects too?), family and those knocking on the door. Two independent courses are here drawn up, that of Torah study and that of acts of loving- kindness (as gemilut basadim was to be redefined later). What is paramount for one sage is not paramount for the other.60 VIII However, it was Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai in the second century A.D.- perhaps even some earlier sage-who noted that the two courses have to intersect, possibly to overlap.6' "Rabbi Yohanan said in the name of Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai: What is the meaning of the verse (Isa. 32:20), 'Happy shall you be who sow by all waters, who send out cattle and asses to pasture?' [This:] Whoever engages in study of Torah and acts of lovingkind- ness is worthy of the inheritance of two tribes [Joseph and Issachar] ... For sowing is a reference to naught but charity (sedaqah)"--here equated with "acts of lovingkindness": note the Hosea verse now to be quoted, in full- "as it is said (Hosea 10:12), 'Sow charity (sedaqah) for yourselves; [reap in accordance with lovingkindness (besed).'] And Water is a reference to naught but Torah, as it is said [Isa. 55:1], 'Ho, all who are thirsty, come for water.' "62 60. Miss Rhoda Grady suggests to me that in his saying Yose ben Yoezer speaks of the home in terms of receiving, whereas Yose ben Yohanan talks of the home as a place of giving. As to gemilut basadim, cf. the reference in n. 6, above. 61. I am not referring back to the saying of Simeon the Righteous in PA 1:2, for he is not speaking of Torah and gemilut basadim in their later sense (cf. again the reference in n. 6, above). As for Shammai's saying (PA 1:15), note the meaning of qeva' in both versions of ARN (pp. 47 and 56)-hence, despite the third clause which may or can be an aspect of gemilut basadim (ARN, pp. 48, 57), the first clause is not speaking of study of Torah. 62. B. T. Bava Qamma 17a, end of chap. I (see ibid. on the two tribes). Al-Nakawa, Menorat ha-ma'or, first chapter (on sedaqah, charity), opens with this passage. For further thought: Though the name Yose is not uncommon both in literary texts and inscriptions, is it coincidence or is it significant that both leaders are called Yose (or, Yosef); that the one who wants the home to be a meeting-place for scholars is from Seredah, while the one who wants the home to be wide open is from Jerusalem? Is there some remote, however slight connection between the popular name Yose and that soubriquet formula (M. Sanhedrin</page><page sequence="22">62 JUDAH GOLDIN 7:5), "Yose [God] damn Yose?" (Cf. J. N. Epstein, "Li-leshon nezirut," Sefer Magnes [Jerusa- lem, 1938], p. 11.) Was Yose(f) ben Yoezer known as basid she-bi-khehunah (the pious one of the priesthood, M. Hagigah 2:7), because though a priest he esteemed the sages? But see Zacharias Frankel, Darkhei ha-Mishnah (Warsaw, 1923), pp. 33-34 and Albeck, Mishnah, Neziqin, p. 485. Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai called his disciple, R. Yose the priest, basid (PA 2:8). Coincidence? Note the second clause in his saying, PA 2:12: What of R. Yose Qatunta, whoever he was (M. Soiah 9:15; cf. Aaron Hyman, Toldoth Tannaim Ve'Amoraim, 3 vols. [Lon- don, 1910], 2: 741-42)?</page></plain_text>
