Ferziger Cemeteries are a powerful religious symbol, but they seemed especially sig nificant for German Jewry.... The cemetery was offered as proof by the Jew that he belonged...cemetery symbolized community.1 Introduction When Chief Rabbi Hayim (Vittorio) Castiglioni of Rome (b. 1840) passed away in 1911, he was cremated as per his request and his ashes were then buried in the Jewish cemetery of his native Trieste. One local Jewish newspaper pointed out that Castiglioni's position—cremation is permitted according to Jewish law and is even preferable to traditional burial—was definitely a minority one within the Italian rabbinate.2 By no means, however, was he accused by any of his rabbinic colleagues of being a heretic.3 Had the same event transpired in Germany at that time, Castiglioni's last request would have garnered a far different reception. While many liberal rabbis would have respected his will, all of the Orthodox figures would have declared 1.

Ferziger him to be a sinner whose final pernicious act cast a dark shadow on the deeds of a lifetime. Some would have even maintained that he had forfeited his Jewish iden tity altogether.4 Nevertheless, in the first decade of the twentieth century the German Ortho dox rabbinate was split by a rift between two neighboring religious leaders from the Hamburg region regarding a seemingly technical question of Jewish law con nected to cremation. During the controversy that ensued, scores of articles were published in the German-Jewish press along with numerous books and pamphlets. Ultimately many of the most prominent rabbinic figures from Germany and for that matter throughout the greater Jewish world openly took sides. The focus of the German Orthodox conflict was one that did not sit at the center of the Italian debate—the question of burial: if a person went ahead despite the prohibition and demanded cremation, and this request was fulfilled, was it permissible for the burned remains to be interred in a Jewish cemetery?5 On the surface, this uncertainty could be resolved by clarifying a number of religio-legal issues. Did the ashes possess the status, according to halakhah, of a body? If so, then regardless of the iniquity of the initial transgression the commu nity, or at least the family, would continue to be obligated by the biblical com mandment of burial, kavor tikberenu (Deuteronomy 21:23).6 Even if no positive obligation existed, might it still be required to dispose of the ashes properly, whether to prevent further desecration, or because they would render living indi viduals (such as kohanim, priestly descendants of Aaron) ritually impure unless appropriately sequestered, or due to the proscription against gaining benefit from a corpse (issur hana 'ah)!1 These themes were certainly addressed in great detail. Yet at the core of the Hamburg dispute one detects more fundamental questions regarding toleration of varieties of observance, the nature of the Jewish collective, and the symbolic meaning of burial. Among others: Should cremation be considered a more diabo lical transgression than other so-called "classical" sins such as Sabbath desecra tion? To what extremes is the community expected to go to prevent Jews from committing particularly odious acts? And what ought to be the relationship 4. See Falk Wiesemann, "Jewish Burials in Germany: Between Tradition, the Enlightenment and the Authorities," Leo Baeck Institute Year Book 37 (1992), 29-30 [17-31]. Wiesemann's brief dis cussion of cremation focuses primarily on debates among liberal figures. In addition, he addresses the 1906 controversy in Wiirzburg over cremation-ash burial in which the state eventually forced the Ortho dox Rabbi Nathan Bamberger to allow a separate building to be erected in the Jewish cemetery to house urns with ashes. 5. Malkiel, "Tekhnologiyah ve-tarbut," 57, points out that in Italy, where the first industrial crema torium in the world was established in Milan in 1875, even an arch opponent of cremation such as Rabbi Elijah Benamozegh of Livorno asserted that once the act had taken place the ashes should be given a proper burial in the Jewish cemetery. For Benamozegh's discussion of this subject, which was cited by German figures as well, see Eliyahu Benamozegh, Ya 'ane ba- 'esh (Livorno: E. Benamozegh and Sons, 1906). 6.

A close reading of the respective arguments of the central protagonists reveals ways in which this episode cultivated further Orthodox approaches to engagement with nonobservance, which had first been articulated in the mid-nineteenth century. Moreover, it highlights how the contro versy represents an innovative stage in this process that moved beyond relatively recent precedents. In this light, special attention is paid to the unique characteristics of crema tion and burial of the ashes as a form of religious deviation—in particular, why these traits precipitated the emergence of this practice as such a powerful and uti litarian sign for marking the outer margin of the Jewish collective at this historical juncture. Cremation, it will be argued, served as an especially potent boundary marker, in part because it was a relatively new deviation against which a broad based Jewish consensus could still be built. Beyond this, the deed itself is endowed with unusual characteristics and symbolic meanings that distinguish it from the vast majority of acts of religious delinquency encountered in traditional and modern rabbinic literature and communal life. Drawing the Battle Lines In 1901 Rabbi Yisrael Hayim Braun (1869-1942) of Halle, Germany, pub lished a pamphlet titled Beit Yisrael, where he collected the opinions of several Central European Orthodox rabbis regarding the issue of burial of the ashes of Jews who, based on personal requests during their lifetimes, had been cremated.10 8. Malkiel's fine study, "Tekhnologiyah ve-tarbut," 39-50, offers an excellent review of the rel evant premodern legal and mystical literature. Furthermore, he highlights the relationship between debates over cremation and the broader theme of the interaction between Jewish law, cultural shifts, and modem technology. Beyond differences in geographical concentration, my discussion focuses on burial of the ashes rather than cremation itself. The analysis is, moreover, oriented toward issues of identity, the emergence of new legal and social constructs, and the worldviews of the protagonists. 9.

Yisrael Hayim Braun, Beit Yisrael 1 (Pecs: Maier Segel Rosenbaum, 1901). Some opinions were expressed in direct personal correspondences, while others appeared first as responses to a query 73</page><page sequence="4">Adam S. Ferziger This question was not a completely new one, nor was it restricted to Jewish frame works. Ever since the emergence of cremation technology in the 1870s along with a social movement to support it, debates had been raging within European society in general and especially among religious circles. 1 Proponents of cremation focused on the hygienic benefits to be achieved through this form of disposal of the dead.12 Some also presented cremation as an "enlightened" rejection of irrational religious concepts such as "the world to come" and "the resurrection of the dead."13 In 1886 the Catholic Church unilaterally forbade cremation. The papal declaration was later codified into a canon that denied ecclesiastical burial to anyone who asked to be cremated unless they repented before their death.14 In a pamphlet published in 1898, the German Protestant church also came out vocif erously against cremation.15 As to Jewish authorities, the Italian rabbis had been deliberating throughout the 1880s and 1890s, and numerous religious figures had engaged the issue in other locales as well.16 Beit Yisrael, however, was the first collection of Jewish legal responsa with a section dedicated solely to the issue of cremation and interment of the ashes. Its publication came at a time when there were already nine functioning crematoria in Germany. Based on the statistics that are available from Gotha, established in 1878 as the first industrial cremation facility in Germany, by the turn of the twentieth century the number of people being cremated on a yearly basis was already in the thousands.17 In 1918 the figure had reached over 14,000. The vast majority were Protestants, although hun dreds of Jews and Catholics were among those who made this choice as well.18 that Braun published in a Hungarian rabbinic journal.

His instructions to the Hamburg Jewish burial society were to refrain from any involvement with the corpse beforehand or with the ashes after the pro cedure. Nonetheless, he ruled that the family should bury the ashes, but only in a separate section of the Jewish cemetery dedicated solely to that purpose.23 Apparently unbeknownst to Hirsch, another prominent rabbinic figure in his vicinity objected vociferously to this judgment. Only in the fall of 1902 (Kislev 5663) did this individual come to the fore, when an article by Chief Rabbi Mayer Lerner (1857-1930) of Altona24—the adjoining Jewish community that had for many years been attached to Hamburg—was published in the Jerusalem based rabbinic journal Hame'asef25 Lerner, himself an accomplished talmudist and scientific scholar of rabbinic literature, critiqued vehemently a rabbi from a 19.

Hirsch was a Hungarian-born Torah scholar, who had attended university as well. He was not related to the most influential German Orthodox rabbi of the nineteenth century, Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch (1808-88) of Frankfurt am Main. His immediate prior post was that of chief rabbi of Prague. Basic biographical discussions of Markus Hirsch are available in "Markus Hirsch," Ency clopaedia Judaica 2nd ed. (Detroit; Jerusalem: Thomson-Gale; Keter, 2007), 9:127; "Zum Geburtstag von Oberrabbiner Marcus Hirsch a.A," Hamburger Familienblatt, September 2, 1933; "Markus Hirsch," The Jewish Encyclopedia (New York and London: Funk and Wagnalls, 1916), 6:413-14; obit uary - [Nachruf] of Markus Hirsch, Israelitisches Familienblatt, May 26,1909; Jewish Chronicle, Feb ruary 21, 1903, 24.

His decision for the Hamburg community was already reported in the German Orthodox press in January 1897, but the responsum that he penned was first published in the 1901 collection. See Der Israelit 117 (January 25, 1897): 7. 23. Mordecai Amram [Markus] Hirsch, "Teshuva zayin," in Braun, Beit Yisrael, 43b^l5b. 24. Lerner was Polish born but had been educated in both of the famed institutions founded by Rabbi Azriel Hildesheimer at which intensive talmudic studies were combined with secular education: the yeshiva in Eisenstadt and the Berlin Rabbiner Seminar. For two partisan biographies of Lerner, see Yitzhak Dov Feld, "Toldot ha-mehaber," in Mayer Lerner, Hadar ha-karmel (London: Shimshon Raphael Lerner, 1971), 1-29; Julius Jung, "Rabbi Dr. Mayer Lerner: The Federation's First Rabbi," in Champions of Orthodoxy (London: self-published, 1974), 1-29. The former in particular offers a great deal of detail about Lerner, including extensive citations from his personal correspondence. 25. According to his biographer, already in 1902 Lerner had been queried about interment of the ashes of cremation and had forbidden doing so. See Feld, "Toldot ha-mehaber," 18. 75</page><page sequence="6">Adam S. Ferziger "certain" community who permitted the burial of cremation-ashes in a specially designated area of the Jewish cemetery.26 Lerner also took issue with a previous ruling by this same rabbi regarding re-interment of bodies from a Jewish cemetery due to new public roads construction in the area.27 He claimed, in fact, that this authority had rendered "bad" decisions and that it was incumbent upon others "to rebuke him."28 These assertions were reiterated in a submission that appeared during the summer of 1903 in the German Orthodox weekly, Der Israelii. Although Hirsch was not mentioned by name, both geographic proximity and Lerner's own understanding of the issue demonstrate beyond a doubt that this negative assessment was aimed directly at the Hamburg neighbor.29 Indeed the attack on Hirsch and his legal policies did not go unanswered for long. In 1904, the Hungarian-born spiritual leader of the Munich Orthodox community, Rabbi Heinrich (Hanoch) Ehrentreu (1854-1927), published a twenty-one-page pamphlet titled Heker halakha,30 It was dedicated to defending the stand of his mentor and father-in-law, Markus Hirsch.31 In parallel, a series of interchanges 26. Although disputes among rabbis are by no means a rarity, Hamburg/Altona holds a special place in this pantheon due to the famous mid-eighteenth-century debate between Jacob Emden and Jonathan Eybeschutz that divided the European rabbinate. See, e.g., Mortimer J. Cohen, Jacob Emden: A Man of Controversy (Philadelphia: Dropsie College, 1937), 81-101; Sid Z. Leiman, "When a Rabbi Is Accused of Heresy," Essays in Honor of Mai-vin Fox 3 (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1989), 179-94; Jacob J. Schacter, "Rabbi Jacob Emden: Life and Major Works" (PhD diss., Harvard University, 1988), 370-498. 27. Due to a road being built in the vicinity of the cemetery established at Ottensen in 1713, there was concern over desecration of the graves. In similar cases, Hirsch had long advocated building a bridge to prevent grave desecration without needing to re-inter those buried there. Lerner, by contrast, suggested selling the cemetery property and re-interring the corpses in a newer Jewish cemetery outside the city limits. See Der Israelit 45 (1904). As with cremation, debates regarding public works on old burial grounds and re-interment have surfaced periodically throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, both in Europe and especially in the State of Israel. This topic shares some commonalities with the cremation controversies but is predicated primarily on separate themes and is deserving of independent treatment.

Throughout this period Lerner was canvassing support for his position forbidding burial of the ashes as well as that regarding re-interment of corpses in a new cemetery. All told, 150 rabbis from Germany, Holland, Hungary, Galicia, Poland, Russia, the United States, Egypt, and the Land of Israel sent letters that were published along with an expanded version of Lerner's original 1903 essay and a point-by-point response to Ehrentreu in the book Hayei 'olam that came out in 1905.32 By no means did this manifesto signal the end of the debate, and in 1907 the Hirsch/Ehrentreu camp published its own response to Hayei 'olam in the form of a booklet titled 'Or ha-'emetP For the next few years the issue reappeared continually in the pages of Der Israelit, with representatives of each side seeking to prove the correctness of their respect ive positions. Legal Categories and Social Implications According to Markus Hirsch of Hamburg an individual who requested to be cremated after death was clearly aposhe'a (infidel), and was classified as aporesh mi-darkhei ha-zibbur, one who has separated him/herself from the ways of the col lective. Following the codified law for such persons, it was forbidden to perform any traditional procedures prior to cremation such as ritual purification (taharah), placing the corpse in burial shrouds, or escorting the body. Even family members were not to mourn, nor carry out b-i'a—rending of a personal garment; and if they were kohanim (of priestly ancestry) they were barred from becoming ritually impure by coming into contact with the remains as would normally be allowed for immediate relatives.34 Notwithstanding, Hirsch concluded that the physical transformation that the body undergoes through cremation does not nullify the prohibition against gaining benefit from a corpse.35 Therefore, after-the-fact burial was still required to assure proper disposal of the remains. Still, ostensibly in order to clarify the severity of the sin of cremation, he dictated that the ashes were to be interred in a separately demarcated area of the Jewish cemetery away from the rest of the graves.36 Such a position found precedent in the custom regarding those who commit suicide.37 Moreover, some prominent German Orthodox rabbis of this period had suggested acting similarly in regard to burial of Jews who had not been circumcised.38 32.

Ferziger, Exclusion and Hierarchy: Orthodoxy, Nonobservance, and the Emergence of Modern Jewish Identity (Philadephia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2005), 180-83. 77</page><page sequence="8">Adam S. Ferziger At the conclusion of his responsum, Hirsch added a comment that points to his awareness of the social significance of his decision. Despite the legal justifica tion of his position, numerous stalwart Orthodox members of his congregation appealed to him to prohibit burial of the ashes in the Jewish cemetery altogether as a means of discouraging those considering cremation from going through with it. In response he explained: "At this time, for it is a difficult period, the reli gious court lacks the strength to make such an emergency declaration. Therefore, it is not within our hands to decide [based on any other criterion] except upon the principles of the Talmud and the earlier authorities."39 Simply put, even in cosmo politan twentieth-century Hamburg, the basic principles of the halakhah had to be upheld. But the advancement of additional stringencies not absolutely required by law was beyond the purview of the local religious court. There is a degree of ambivalence to Hirsch's words that opens them up to alternative interpretations. On the one hand, they can be read as an expression of regret that the formal authority of contemporary rabbis was weak and dependent on the graces of the secular government. Under the existing, less-than-ideal cir cumstances they were not at liberty to adopt the preferred tactic of deterrence by enacting proactively strict rulings. That said, Hirsch's concluding sentence also alludes to his fear of alienating those who would respond negatively to the adoption of a combative stance that would leave them unable to memorialize some Jewish brethren within the local communal cemetery. In his refutations, Mayer Lerner of Altona aimed to undermine the "lenient" decision of Hirsch regarding burial within the confines of a Jewish cemetery. He argued from numerous perspectives that the ashes did not have the status of a body according to the halakhah and did not render living people ritually impure. Fur thermore, he introduced "metahalakhic" reasoning grounded in his perception of social realities to a far greater degree than did his rival interlocutor. Like some of Hirsch's own Orthodox constituents, Lerner posited in his initial 1903 article that any moderation connected to cremation would encourage others to follow suit—as they would know that even this act would not cause them to forfeit their burial rights.40 In addition, since the Christians were so adamantly against cremation, for the Jews to be any less vociferous in their reactions would constitute a grave public desecration of God's name—a hillul ha-shem 41 Follow ing this train of thought, in his later work Hayei 'olam Lerner added the fear that if burial of cremated remains were to become normative practice, it would eventually challenge the historic right of European Jews to maintain their own exclusive cem etery grounds. For the local Christian authorities would protest that Jews should certainly prefer being buried with upright Christians than together with evil Jewish cremationists.42 39.

Lerner, Hayei 'olam, xxiii. 78</page><page sequence="9">Ashes to Outcasts Lerner's 1903 article also puts forward the initial elements of an evaluation of the cremationists themselves, further developed in his 1905 book, as the worst kind of sinners imaginable—"having reached [seen] the entrance to hell [they still] refused to repent."43 Accordingly, there was no basis for drawing parallels between them and those who committed suicide, since the latter were unfortunates who "were driven crazy by their bitter hearts."44 Most revealing, he rejected the possibility of categorizing such people as "infants taken captive"—tinokot she nishbu—whose deficient knowledge of Jewish law, according to prominent German Orthodox authorities of the previous generation, would exonerate them from culpability for their errant behavior.45 The vast majority of those who chose cremation, according to Lerner, were known to have abandoned basic Jewish practice. Thus their cremation only concretized the fact that they "have absolutely no vestige of Judaism left in them."46 Cremationists and Other Modern Sinners This last remark underscores the implications of Lerner's debate with Hirsch beyond the specifics of cremation, and locates the discussion within a broader topic that had occupied the Orthodox throughout the previous century: how to relate to their nonobservant brethren. According to talmudic and medieval rabbinic sources, Jews who live sinful lifestyles, such as public Sabbath desecraters and persistent consumers of forbidden foods, are to be penalized and cast out by sub jecting them to a variety of religious and social sanctions.47 The Babylonian Talmud, for example, proclaims that "a public Sabbath desecrater is like a Gentile in all ways."48 Such an exclusionary approach, even if only partially implemented in practice, could be sustained in the religiously and socially bifur cated atmosphere of medieval and early modern Europe. As the percentages of Central and Western-European Jews who had abandoned observance grew dra matically in the nineteenth century, however, the Orthodox who remained com mitted to traditional standards of the halakhah were confronted with the dilemma of how Jewish law and communal policy should be formulated in response to these new and unprecedented circumstances. Put in other words, when over 50 percent of the Jews in some areas no longer abided by the basic Sabbath restrictions, was there any justification or feasibility for treating public Sabbath desecrators as notorious deviants who are denied various rights and privileges within social or ritual contexts?49 In point of fact, by the first decade 43.

Ferziger of the twentieth century, when the cremation controversy erupted, the number of Sabbath desecraters in Germany had risen closer to 80 percent.50 One of the most original and influential efforts to address this new predica ment was penned in 1860 by Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger, mid-nineteenth-century Germany's most authoritative rabbinic decisor, who—coincidentally for the current discussion—spent the majority of his career as chief rabbi of Altona.51 He distinguished between contemporary Sabbath desecraters and the category as described in premodern codes on both theological and circumstantial grounds. For one, the classical figures were assumed to have been motivated by heretical intentions—lack of belief in the biblical account of creation—while the behavior of most of the new offenders stemmed primarily from economic and social considerations and did not necessarily reflect an abandonment of core precepts. Moreover, he extended further a perspective first introduced in the twelfth century by Maimonides regarding Karaite children, by applying the tal rnudic case of an "infant taken captive" to most modern public Sabbath desecra tors.52 This principle implied that people who lack fundamental Jewish knowledge, like the majority of Ettlinger's generation, cannot be held responsible for their delinquent religious behavior. Thus, such individuals would no longer be deemed intentional sinners and certain classical sanctions could be suspended.53 This new conceptual foundation was used broadly by numerous Orthodox authorities from the last decades of the nineteenth century onward and became the centerpiece for a fresh approach toward nonobservant Jews that continues to inform rabbinic discourse until today. Some Orthodox figures, however, demon strated ambivalence toward the sweeping potential of this leniency. In fact, there were streams intent on combating or at the very least not lending credence to divergence from the tradition rejected this position outright.54 On the surface, Lerner would appear to fall into the latter category.

However, his decision to raise this terminology in his dis course and then demur suggests that he was not only familiar with but even open to its use under other conditions. Indeed, in a responsum he authored that appears in his posthumously published collection Hadar ha-karmel, Lerner actually rec ommended applying the tinok she-nishbah leniency to modern Sabbath desecraters.55 He was quite aware of this selective utilization, and at the end of his 1905 work, Hayei 'olam, Lerner took pains to explain why those who requested crema tion were far worse than other contemporary sinners and did not meet the criteria necessary to be judged mercifully. Among the "evildoers" [reshaim] who consume forbidden foods and desecrate the Sabbath, .. .there are still many for which the last spark of Jewish religion has not been extinguished, and even though they have transgressed nearly every prohibi tion in the Torah they still tremble from the entrance to Hell. Therefore, they request to be buried according to the ways of the land (the traditional practice). Those who command that their corpses be cremated, by contrast, not only do they lack fear of the day of death, their "hearts are as large as a grand meeting hall."56 For Lerner then, as for Ettlinger, personal religious observance had ceased to func tion as a baseline for Jewish identity. Nonetheless, a boundary between normative Jews and outcasts—albeit a new one—still existed. Compliance with Sabbath and dietary restrictions had been replaced by traditional burial as the minimal require ment for being treated as a regular member of the community. The decline in reli gious adherence was certainly lamented by Lerner, but he had to some degree come to terms with it. Yet he was intent on preserving a nominal level of connec tion between Jewish existence in his day and the standards of the past. As he put it, "For what still remains? Are not the great commandments like Sabbath obser vance, in these difficult times [be-zuk ha-'itim], rapidly diminishing...what will be of the Torah?"57 Thus, those who rejected that which he considered to be the last remaining element in Jewish identity were no longer even worthy of inclusion in a Jewish cemetery. This distinction by Lerner between cremationists and other sinners was sub sequently vilified by Heinrich Ehrentreu of Munich, who from 1903 undertook the role of chief disputant and defender of the position set down by his less combative father-in-law, Markus Hirsch of Hamburg.58 Recall that in 1904 Ehrentreu 55.

In Ehrentreu, Heker halakha, 2, the author notes his father-in-law's unwillingness to enter into a written polemic. 81</page><page sequence="12">Adam S. Ferziger published a booklet, Heker halakha,59 in which he reacted vehemently to Lerner's disagreements with Hirsch, regarding both re-interment and burial of the cremation-ashes.60 In 1907 Rabbi Shimon Deutsch of Fiirth, a close student and colleague of Ehrentreu, received his mentor's permission to publish a series of letters in a pamphlet titled 'Or ha-'emet. There Ehrentreu once again took Lerner to task both on substantive and personal grounds. By this time, not only was the cremation controversy a source of legal and ideological dispute, but it had nurtured a deeply adversarial dynamic between these two prominent and learned German Orthodox figures. According to Ehrentreu the cremationists were for the most part no different than most other nonobservant Jews of the day whose behavior was certainly mis guided but nevertheless tolerated. If Lerner, he challenged, was so eager to dis tinguish between observant Jews and sinners, why did he (or for that matter most German Orthodox rabbis other than those in secessionist Orthodox commu nities that had their own cemeteries) put up with full-fledged Jewish burials for public Sabbath desecrators, not to mention those who did not circumcise their 59. Although Ehrentreu's Heker halakha appeared before Lerner's Hayei 'olam, Ehrentreu explains in his introduction that he had already come across the leaves (galleys) of this book during a visit to a printing house in Krakow. Therefore, Ehrentreu's discussion includes references to some of Lerner's yet-unpublished claims, including his portrayal of the sin of cremation as tantamount to the idolatrous Moloch worship of biblical times. In addition to his revised original essay and the letters of support by 150 other rabbis, Lerner succeeded in including an addendum to Hayei 'olam titled 'Or ha- 'emet in which he responded point by point to Ehrentreu's critique. 60. Ehrentreu, Heker halakha, 10. Regarding technical legal disagreements, Ehrentreu both pro duced new support for his father-in-law's reasoning and added additional arguments of his own. Lerner had stated that there was no need to bury the ashes in order to uphold the prohibition of gaining benefit from the corpse since the ashes would certainly be preserved in a marked urn or in a designated area at the public crematorium. Thus, the remains would be treated appropriately. Ehrentreu (11-12, 15) refuted this point by claiming that over time family members or others might not take proper precau tions and eventually the vessel would be misidentified. He also asserted (16-17) that even after indus trial cremation, some small bone chips remain visible, thus from a legal perspective a body exists and a kohen who comes into contact with it would become impure. Furthermore, the commandment of kavor tikberenu could still be fulfilled. This perception of the physical facts contradicted Lerner's claim that the transformation to dust detached the new material from its previous form and its accompanying legal status. Notably, Ehrentreu stated that his "research" of cremation procedures and the final product did not entail personal examination. Rather he based himself on "eyewitness accounts by persons of integ rity." Nonetheless, he called Lerner to task for stating, "without a doubt our eyes see" that all the bones lose their composition. Ironically, Ehrentreu even added, "...he [Lerner] did not see this himself, he just heard from others who lack full knowledge of the issues." Lerner later noted this discrepancy in Hayei 'olam, 121 (no. 29-30). The fact that neither of the two rabbis had actually observed the cremation process connects this episode to another significant controversy related to modern technology and hala khah that began in the previous century. In 1858 a major dispute erupted regarding the permissibility of utilizing matzah-baking machines to prepare the unleavened bread for Passover. In that case, many of those who adopted a prohibitive stance had not become personally familiar with the new invention. See Hayim Gertner, '"Mazot machine': pulmus ha-hilkhati ke-kli le-hagdarat zehut ortodoksit," in Salmon, Ravitzky, and Ferziger, Ha-ortodoksiyah ha-yehudit, 395-426; Meir Hildesheimer and Yehoshua Lie berman, "The Controversy Surrounding Machine-made Matzof. Halakhic, Social, and Economic Repercussions," HUCA 75 (2004): 214-16 [193-255], 82</page><page sequence="13">Ashes to Outcasts sons or those who had come to terms with the apostasy of their own offspring? 1 Meanwhile, Jews who had asked to be cremated were denied even a dishonorable interment. Surely, suggests Ehrentreu, the habitual transgressions represented much more critical signs of an abandonment of Jewish tradition than the one-time act of cremation. At this juncture, he argues that ...the true evildoers are those who refuse to enter the Israelite congregation either in life or in death and do not ask that their ashes be brought to Israelite burial, whereas those who wish to receive an Israelite burial—their end proves that their initial impetus was not to undermine central religious tenets or the Torah itself, but rather due to others' concerns. If we shall rule strictly in their regard, then crooked justice will have been rendered, and people will decry the biased nature of the issue."62 Therefore, just as the Orthodox community had addressed other forms of religious deviance in a way that did not demand a complete casting out of the perpetrators, so should the case be regarding those who had been cremated. Beyond challenging the fundamental integrity of his adversary's ruling, a central upshot of Ehrentreu's articulation is that at a historical juncture when no more than 30 percent of all German Jews adhered to traditional practice, the very idea of religious authorities in heterogeneous communities declaring a Jew totally beyond the pale was essentially obsolete. The only individuals who truly sat outside the communal boundary were those who of their own volition had decided to place themselves there by reneging on Jewish burial. Burial, Belonging, and Tolerance in Early Twentieth-Century Orthodox Thought This last argument by Ehrentreu suggests a novel formulation of what con stituted a positive Jewish identity under the circumstances prevailing in early twentieth-century Germany. Namely, the very desire to be buried in a Jewish cem etery—even after cremation—demonstrated the individual's fundamental attach ment to the "Israelites." By discerning meaningful declarations of Jewish identity in behaviors—such as Jewish burial—that were once taken for granted, Ehrentreu's pronouncement moved beyond the tolerant outlook rendered by Ettlinger during the mid-nineteenth century. Indeed, it raises intriguing compari sons to other better-known approaches put forward during the early twentieth century by Orthodox rabbis outside Germany who sought to judge nonobservant Jews favorably. 61. On the debates over separate burial grounds for the secessionist Orthodox communities, see Ferziger, Exclusion and Hierarchy, 105-8, 127-30, 146-49; Robert Liberies, Religious Conflict in a Social Context: The Resurgence of Orthodox Judaism in Frankfurt Am Main, 1838-1877 (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 1985), 216. 62. Hanoch Ehrentreu, "Letter 4," in Deutsch, 'Or ha-'emet, 15. 83</page><page sequence="14">Adam S. Ferziger In an essay penned in 1913, for example, Rabbi Abraham Isaac ha-Kohen Kook analyzed the Jewish identity of young Zionist pioneers associated with the socialist Ha-Shomer ha-Tsa'ir movement who were slain by Arabs while guarding a new kibbutz settlement. He took pains to distinguish between these figures and religious deviants from previous eras: "...those in the past who separated from the ways of the community intended to destroy the nation.... From this perspective we can be comforted, for our sons, distanced as they are ... their souls are comple tely at one with our nation's sorrows ... and could never be considered as if they are 'not from among us.'"61 In the eyes of Kook, then, acts that demonstrated an indi vidual's deep-seated connection to the Jewish nation were testament to their funda mental membership in the fold and could at least partially neutralize the ill effects of other rebellious behaviors. Similarly, those in Ehrentreu's orbit who asked to be cre mated but also to be buried in a Jewish cemetery were certainly not conducting themselves ideally. Nevertheless, their final interment requests could be viewed as a predominant assertion of personal attachment to the Jewish people. Having acknowledged similarities between Ehrentreu and the rabbi from the Land of Israel, Kook's position needs to be understood in light of his overall positive appreciation for the role played by secular Zionists—especially those who dedicated their lives to building up the land and defending its Jewish inhabitants—in the redemptive process. Grounding himself in Lurianic mystical thought, Kook was not only open to historical distinctions between sinners of the past and the present. He actually perceived some of the seemingly seditious deeds of secular Zio nists as being crucial building blocks toward messianic times, for they facilitated the emergence of nationalist elements that had lain dormant for hundreds of years.64 Ehrentreu, by contrast, addressed a Diaspora constituency, and there is no reason to assume that he was party to Kook's mystical discourse. Even closer parallels with the point of view advanced by Ehrentreu regard ing the cremationists can be found in the writings of Rabbi Hayim Hirshenson (1857-1935). Like Kook, this original religious thinker and prolific author devoted a great deal of his literary output to issues related to the burgeoning Jewish settlement in the Land of Israel. Yet he served for over thirty years as rabbi of an Orthodox congregation in Hoboken, New Jersey.65 In this capacity 63. Abraham Isaac ha-Kohen Kook, '"Al bamoteinu hallalim," Sinai 17 (1945): 1-5. For other reasons explained in the essay, Kook expressed ambivalence about eulogizing the two young men. In the end, however, he found an acceptable justification for speaking at the funeral.

In developing an approach to these people, Hirshenson distinguished several categories of religious deviance. One variety was people influenced by scientific learning who question religious truths and hallowed observances. Rather than simply deriding them for being carried away by "foreign" ideas, Hirshenson con sidered their deviance to have resulted from their intellectual honesty. As such, even their heretical behaviors should not be cause for judging them harshly or dis tancing them from their Jewish brethren. The worst types of sinners, moreover, were the "principled assimilationists," whose errant practices reflected deep-seated ideo logical opposition to traditional Jewish law and theological tenets. Yet even they, it turned out, attended synagogue from time to time due to familial or communal responsibilities. According to Hirshenson, such visits did not neutralize the sinful regimens and heretical beliefs of these individuals, yet these occasional appearances did demonstrate that "they want to be Jewish."66 Therefore, while he would not permit members of the latter group to receive synagogue honors, he maintained that by joining services they had performed a form of repentance—their prayers had legitimacy and should not be deemed abominations. In their analysis of Hirshenson, Avi Sagi and Zvi Zohar argue that he did not claim that by attending synagogue these sinning individuals had demonstrated allegiance to normative Jewish theological notions. He recognized their presence, rather, as a positive statement regarding their attachment to the Jewish collective. This in itself was a valuable act that mitigated their delinquencies and warranted viewing them sympathetically. Hirshenson's ruling, then, was predicated on the idea that independent assertions of "ethnic" Jewish identity on the part of nonob servant Jews have compelling implications for how religious authorities should relate to them.67 In the words of Sagi and Zohar, "At the moment when this person confirms his/her Jewish identification...there is no justification for the members of the collective to alienate themselves from him/her."68 This brief discussion of Hirshenson sheds further light on Ehrentreu's efforts to sustain the Jewish identity of those who chose cremation yet demanded burial in a Jewish cemetery. For one, Ehrentreu perceived that most Jews who asked to be cremated did not do so in order to debunk hallowed concepts such as "the world to come" and "the resurrection of the dead." Instead, they were convinced by scien tific and medical data that this was the ideal method for disposal of their bodies. This explanation bears similarities to that of Hirshenson, who judged somewhat favorably those who—because of their intellectual honesty rather than any core heretical impulse—had adopted practices that went against Jewish law. Ehren treu's contention, moreover, that "the true evildoers are those who refuse to enter the Israelite congregation either in life or in death and do not ask that 66.

Ibid., 180. 85</page><page sequence="16">Adam S. Ferziger their ashes be brought to Israelite burial" bears a distinct resemblance to Hirshen son's portrayal of "principled assimilationists" who sometimes attend synagogue. In fact, theoretically such a parallel could even encourage a lenient approach regarding those who rejected the world to come and resurrection outright but still desired Jewish interment. Both rabbinic figures maintained that unpious indi viduals' decision to be counted within frameworks dedicated to Jewish collective existence (albeit postmortem in the case of burial) substantiated their membership in the fold. Applying Sagi and Zohar's interpretation of Hirshenson to Ehrentreu, the polemic with Lerner over burial of cremation-ashes facilitated his articulation of a German Jewish identity predicated on ethnic rather than religious factors. This form of Jewishness was certainly incomplete, but it was sufficiently meaningful to counterbalance the deleterious implications of extreme acts of deviance, most pro minently the demand to be cremated.69 To be sure, Hirshenson was even more radical. He made explicit his willing ness to countenance openly heretical individuals, whereas Ehrentreu preferred to assume that his constituents' sinful acts were more pragmatically inspired. Hirshen son also gave credence to positive activity—synagogue attendance—that only took place occasionally, while Ehrentreu's defense related to burial, a so-to-speak "per manent declaration of allegiance." At the same time, Ehrentreu's very adoption of an ethnic approach is astonishing. Unlike both Kook and Hirshenson, he was far from sympathetic to Zionism. In fact in 1921 he was actually elected by the German Orthodox rabbis as their representative on the Moetzes Gedolei ha-Torah, the council of Torah Sages of the anti-Zionist Agudath Israel movement.70 Between Enclave and Hierarchy Notwithstanding Ehrentreu's impassioned defense of the core Jewish iden tity of those who had chosen cremation, the practical ruling of Hirsch regarding burial of the ashes that his son-in-law Ehrentreu championed would appear to undercut his sharp critique of Lerner. That is, if Ehrentreu truly equated cremation ists with other contemporary sinners who were included fully in the Jewish collec tive, why did he and his mentor persist in denying them full burial honors and relegate their remains to a separate area, while allowing Sabbath desecraters and the like to be interred within the "normative" areas? This seeming internal contradiction in the position of Ehrentreu, I suggest, is indicative of a fundamental approach toward Jewish identity that stood at the core of the ruling first put forward by his father-in-law, Markus Hirsch. A more careful analysis of its conceptual basis will yield a deeper appreciation of Ehrentreu's ideological duel with Lerner. 69.

The former, even if they sometimes ruled leniently on an individual level, maintained the basic stance that divergence from traditional standards of religious behavior or beliefs placed a person beyond the pale of normative Jewish identity. Efforts were made by this camp to focus on "in-out" boundaries and highlight the fact that the observant Orthodox and all other Jews were at most nominally connected to each other, if not completely sep arate entities. To be sure, this approach itself was a departure from the premodern condition in which all Jews living in a given area—other than formal apostates— were assumed to be part and parcel of the local Jewish community.71 The hierarchical position that gained currency in the mid-nineteenth century, by contrast, avoided the sectarian tendency to define an individual as either within the margin or beyond it. It operated instead on the principle that anthropologist Mary Douglas describes as "downgrading."72 That is, under modern circum stances just about all Jews, regardless of their behavior, were considered to be members of an expansive collective. This union, however, was structured as a hier archy, with the top or ideal level occupied by the observant Orthodox alone. Rather than being excluded altogether, the nonobservant were included but "down graded" to a lower point within the collective. Such "internal" boundaries were expressed through the use of formal as well as symbolic divisions. In Ettlinger's example, based on the tinok she-nishbah concept he permitted the ingestion of wine touched by a public Sabbath desecrater, yet he encouraged God-fearing Jews to avoid making use of this leniency—thus maintaining an internal distinc tion between his Orthodox followers and other Jews. Similarly, Rabbi David Zvi Hoffmann of Berlin consented to the inclusion of public Sabbath desecraters in the count for a prayer quorum, but urged Orthodox Jews to make efforts to find a service predicated on at least ten "kosher" Jews.73 For those Orthodox who were intent on or felt compelled to engage their nonobservant brethren, this strategy acknowledged the change in the social cir cumstances and religious lifestyle of most Jews, without undermining religious values. The notion of full-fledged ostracism of others was abandoned, but not the core commitment to observance of the halakhah as the ideal or preferred stan dard. The fusion of these ostensibly incompatible tendencies is encapsulated in the words of anthropologist Louis Dumont: "Hierarchy is... a relation that can succinctly be called 'the encompassing of the contrary'...."74 71.

Ferziger The competing positions of the Hirsch/Ehrentreu and Lerner camps regard ing burial of cremation-ashes both highlight and challenge the utility of the enclavist/hierarchist divide for appreciating early twentieth-century German Orthodoxy.75 Lerner's outlook was rooted, I suggest, within the enclavist approach. In light of the loss of all civil authority and the transformation of Jewish communal life into an essentially voluntary setting, the cemetery remained one of the last vehicles at his disposal for articulating this underlying position. Yet due to widespread nonobservance he was compelled to adjust the criteria for ruling a person outside the boundaries of Jewish life. Thus, he acquiesced regarding the burial of numerous contemporary sinners such as Sabbath desecraters. In denying any type of Jewish burial for cremationists, then, he was not only expressing his disdain for this specific infraction. He was declaring that even within the highly heterogeneous German Jewish society in which he lived, deviant acts could still be isolated that placed an individual beyond the margin of normative Jewish iden tity. By doing so, the enclave was reconstituted, so to speak, but not obliterated. Its essential appraisal of how to define Jewish identity remained intact, with crema tion and burial as the new central litmus test. The 1901 cremation responsum of Rabbi Markus Hirsch of Hamburg, in contrast, articulates a classic hierarchical solution. It exemplifies the tension between the desire to refrain from completely writing off contemporary Jews of any type and the need to declare that cremationists were unqualified sinners who had alienated themselves from core elements of Jewish existence. The former was accomplished by allowing their ashes to be interred in the Jewish cem etery. In declaring, however, that those who demanded cremation were poreshim mi-darkei ha-zibbur and not entitled to any of the normal postmortem honors, Hirsch asserted that through their behavior they had to be "downgraded" dramati cally in relation to other more upright Jews. His stipulation, furthermore, that they be buried in a separate and distinct area of the cemetery concretized the permanent and visually symbolic character of this internal boundaiy. The utility of this strategy gains support from Norbert Fischer's work on the social role of cremation during its initial development within broader German life. He argues that by creating independent industrial means for the disposal of bodies, as well as new frameworks for preservation of the ashes, the cremation movement distanced people from the church, thus weakening the reach of this institution and advancing the secularization process. With such an option available, even in death Christians were no longer dependent on church functionaries or religious services.76 An analogous direction is advanced quite assertively by Jennifer Leaney: the Catholic Church opposed cremation because "the horror and repug nance which the grave inspires are among the most efficacious instruments of the hobgoblin machinery of which Catholic rhetoric makes use in order to humble the faithful."77 The Hirsch/Ehrentreu camp, while theologically at an 75.

Leaney, "Ashes to Ashes," 132.</page><page sequence="19">Ashes to Outcasts opposite point on the spectrum, appear to be similarly cognizant of the danger of irrelevance. By cultivating a policy that preserved the role of the Jewish commu nity in the burial process, but without granting approval to the act of cremation itself, they advanced a relatively beneficent approach to the Jewish identity of their nonobservant contemporaries. In parallel, they also created a dynamic that could safeguard at least one aspect of the role of Jewish religious institutions in the lives of most German Jews—provision of a final resting place. Returning to Ehrentreu's challenge to the Altona rabbi, then, the fact still remains that he called Lerner to task for differentiating between all other contem porary sinners and cremationists. Yet had not he and Hirsch done essentially the same thing within the cemetery through their hierarchical ruling stipulating that only the cremationists were to be denied all burial honors and needed to be interred in a separate section? The assumption that underlies this seeming contradiction is that in the eyes of Ehrentreu the delinquency of the cremationists was qualitatively more severe than that of other contemporary nonobservant Jews—but this was not necessarily the case. Even if he considered them no less sinful than public Sabbath desecraters, from a practical perspective he could have found reason to treat them more harshly. For one, while the preponderance of everyday nonobservance in the early 1900s was already a fait accompli, cremation was still the precinct of a small minority. Thus, even if there were no doubts regarding the core Jewish iden tity of those cremated, the stricter sanctions may have stemmed simply from the conviction that in their case it was still possible to deter individuals from adopting this additional display of irreverence to long-held values. It should be noted as well that unlike other derelictions, the offense of cremation related directly to the sanc tified cemetery environment itself. The internal boundary placement, then, func tioned figuratively to protect the authenticity of traditional cemetery practice. By burying the ashes in a separate section, a statement was being made that as Jewish remains, they were entitled to burial within the borders of the Jewish grounds. Nonetheless, due to the affront of their behavior toward this holy environment, they would be cordoned off into an independent "cemetery within a cemetery." Finally, although not mentioned by Hirsch in his original responsum, Ehrentreu drew support for their position from a ruling on the same topic that had already been rendered in 1888 by Rabbi Nathan Adler (1803-90), the chief rabbi of England's United Synagogue. This decision, asserted the latter, had also received the imprimatur of Rabbi Isaac Elhanan Spektor (1817-96) of Kovno, the preeminent Jewish religious adjudicator of the time, who stated explicitly that the ashes should be buried within the limits of the Jewish cemetery but in a separate portion.78 According to Ehrentreu, Rabbi Azriel Hildesheimer (1820— 99), the rector of the Orthodox rabbinical seminary and rabbi of the separatist Orthodox community in Berlin, and Rabbi Mordechai (Marcus) Horovitz (1844-1919) of the nonseparatist Orthodox Jewish wing (gemeindeorthodoxe) 78. Ehrentreu, "Letter 4," 'Or ha-'emet, 13. 89</page><page sequence="20">Adam S. Ferziger in Frankfurt had also made the same recommendation.79 On this level Hirsch was simply following the lead of like-minded authorities who had preceded him. A New Boundary Marker A case can be made, nevertheless, that Ehrentreu agreed with Lerner that under current circumstances cremation was a particularly degenerate act due to specific characteristics that distinguished it from other major foibles. Where their paths parted was in their respective evaluations of the nature of its depravity, and this was manifest in their dispute over interment. For Lerner there was no doubt that, in distinction to public Sabbath desecra ters, the root cause for all those who demanded cremation was a denial of funda mental Jewish dogmas.80 As he asserted, a cursory reading of Die Flamme (The Flame), the Berlin-based official publication of the secular association for pro motion of cremation, made abundantly clear that "their intention is through crema tion to undermine the entire foundation of faith in the awakening of the deceased and the eternity of the soul. Thus, even if an individual could be found who requested cremation for another reason, their opinion was subsumed ("batel") within the majority of deniers and heretics."81 Ehrentreu was also well aware that some cremationists' critiques were theo logically driven, but his own experience convinced him that generalizing to most of them was inaccurate and hurtful. To illustrate this point, he described a case with which he had dealt in Munich. An eighty-year-old member of the community asked that his body be cremated after death. He stated explicitly that he did not have any ideological ax to grind such as doubting belief in corporeal resurrection. Rather he had read documented cases of people who were thought to have expired but had not and ended up suffering horrific deaths of asphyxiation after burial.82 While Ehrentreu would not condone this person's decision, he felt that it would be inappropriate to deny him the basic right of interment in a Jewish cemetery. The cremation request was unquestionably unacceptable, but it stemmed from fear and did not constitute outright heresy.83 If this was his appraisal of the situation, why did Ehrentreu still persist in preventing the hevra kadisha from ministering to this innocent elderly man and insist that his ashes be buried in a separate section of the cemetery? 79.

This theme received literary attention in English through Edgar Allen Poe's 1844 short story, "The Premature Burial"; full text available at http://www.classic-literature.co.uk/american authors/nineteenth-century/edgar-allan-poe/the-premature-burial/ (accessed August 25, 2010). 83. Ehrentreu, Heker halakha, 12. 90</page><page sequence="21">Ashes to Outcasts A persuasive explanation emerges from a key passage in Ehrentreu's description of the case at hand: "Heaven forbid that I should plead his merit, for he booted the positive commandment of burial, and separated himself from the Israelite congre gation, nevertheless there are no grounds for saying that he rejected corporeal res urrection...." (author's emphasis).84 Despite his theological innocence, this man had committed a grievous offense. By requesting cremation, regardless of his motivation, he had detached himself from the still recognized conventions of his brethren. As opposed to Sabbath observance or dietary restrictions, traditional interment remained the standard. Abandoning it did not erase the perpetrator's membership in the Jewish people, but it marked him as a "deviant" who was dis tinct from the normative group. Thus, the hierarchical dynamic exemplified by setting the graves for cremation-ashes apart from the main burial section reinforced the ambivalent position of Judaism regarding these deceased individ uals. Through their unfortunate behavior, they were transformed from full-fledged members of the congregation into "others" whose location at the periphery mirrored their downgraded standing. The Hirsch/Ehrentreu position, then, resulted from parallel efforts to avoid alienating a rising number of contemporary communal constituents, while simul taneously fortifying the role of religious rectitude in regard to burial as a lingering commonality that still unified most Jews. Indeed, this balancing act emerges already from the initial responsum of Hirsch, who wrote: "but the ash is buried in a special, out of the way place, far from the graves of upright [kosher] people ('anashim kesherim)."85 All Jews who chose to be interred in the commu nal cemetery had a space within the modern Jewish collective, but only those who followed the traditional burial rites received the imprimatur of "kosher" people that meant full membership in the core stratum. The Last Vestige of Common Religious Values Human societies, maintained Emile Durkheim, regularly utilize classifi cation of certain individuals and behaviors outside the normative realm as a means-to coalesce their own mainstreams. In 1892 he wrote: "The deviant act... creates a sense of mutuality among the people of a community by supplying a focus for group feeling. Like a war, a flood, or some other emergency, deviance makes people more alert to the interests they share in common and it draws atten tion to those values which constitute the 'collective conscience' of the commu nity."86 Application of this perception—which is known as the "functional" approach to deviance—will illuminate additional nuances of both the Hirsch/ Ehrentrau and Lerner camps as well as distinctions between them. Moreover, it will advance further the stated aim of examining what underlay the emergence 84. Ibid. 85. Hirsch, "Teshuva zayin," 45b. 86. Emile Durkheim, The Division of Labor in Society, trans.

Ferziger of cremation and burial of the ashes as such a powerful symbol for marking the outer boundary of the Jewish collective in early twentieth-century Germany. At first glance, ostracization of individuals due to their deviant behavior would seem a more apt description of Lerner's enclavist policies than of those of Rabbis Hirsch and Ehrentreu. By casting out the cremationists altogether he sought to engender the unification of the "true" Jews around their common support of traditional burial practice. Ehrentreu, in contrast, retreated from the very idea that a contemporary Jew could be completely stripped of his or her Jewish identity due to delinquency in religious behavior. Yet the analysis above demonstrates that, like his rival, he also saw cremation as a boundary-definition issue. His difference was in his understanding of the symbolic meaning of this deviance. For him cremation marked an internal gradation within the broader Jewish hierarchy rather than one that stood past its outer rim. This common acknowledgment of the marginal status'of cremation demon strates the significance of this issue for evaluating fundamental transformations in German Orthodoxy that move beyond the particulars of the Hamburg region dispute. The discussion cited earlier of distinctions between cremation and other more "classical" sins highlights changes that had transpired within German Ortho dox discourse since the mid-nineteenth century. Rabbinic debates of the previous generations had focused on the degree to which regular (daily or weekly) acts of nonobservance such as public Sabbath desecration relegated a Jew to pariah stand ing or diminished a person's stature within the hierarchy. Despite their sharp dis agreements, both Lerner and Ehrentreu acknowledged that in their day most examples of nonobservance no longer cast deep-seated aspersions on an individ ual's connection to the Jewish collective. Cremation, as such, was not only a new boundary marker, but it served as one of the few remaining ones with broad sig nificance for assessing a person's essential Jewish identity.87 This transition offers a case in point for the more general assertion of soci ologist Kai Erikson that "[boundaries are never a fixed property of any commu nity.... Sometimes changes occur in the surrounding environment, altering that against which the people of the group have measured their own uniqueness."88 Regarding German Jewry, the decline of Sabbath observance from 50 percent to less than 30 percent in the course of about a half a century would appear to have been the decisive "change...in the surrounding environment" that necessi tated the emergence of a new boundary symbol. As their contemporary David Zvi Hoffmann lamented, "...the God-fearing in our times are the ones who are called 'separate' and 'distinct,' while the sinners are the ones who follow the 87. Perhaps exogamy would be an additional example, although, as noted, even intermarriage is reversible whereas cremation is permanent.

It enabled Orthodox rabbis to maintain the position that certain behaviors stood in contradiction to fundamental principles of Jewish identity, while avoiding the need to apply sanctions to the vast majority of members of their communities. To be sure, cremation was not merely a relatively new deviation against which a broad-based Jewish consensus could be built. The act itself is endowed with unique characteristics and symbolic meanings that distinguish it from nearly all other types of religious delinquency. This supplies additional perspective on its utility and potency as a boundary marker at this juncture in German Jewish history. On the one hand, it is an isolated one-time act that takes place after death. By choosing to focus sanctions on it, rabbinic authorities limited the prospects for ongoing, antagonistic confrontations between themselves and nonobservant Jews within their communities. Had they attempted to continue highlighting Sabbath desecration as a major boundary issue, for example, conflicts with Jews in their locales would have only escalated. On the other hand, issues related to death and final interment touched individuals viscerally. Indeed, for many if not most Jews the very idea of being buried outside the Jewish cemetery represented a far more profound level of detachment from their forefathers than any religious deviance during their lifetimes.91 As such, the threat of refusal to bury or even of placement in a section intended for outcasts was potentially effective. More over, as a new phenomenon that drew opposition from authorities across the reli gious spectrum, cremation itself could reasonably be put forward by the rabbis as a particularly radical act of disengagement from the long-held traditions of prior generations. Those who nevertheless asked to be cremated would then be ident ified as modern-style apostates completely outside the margin (Lerner), or, at best, figures that existed on the periphery of the Jewish hierarchical collective (Hirsch/Ehrentreu). Communal versus Familial Identity Rabbi David Zvi Hoffmann was arguably the most prominent German Orthodox rabbinic authority at the turn of the twentieth century. Officially, he served as head of the religious court associated with the separatist Orthodox com munity, Adass Jisroel, in Berlin, and professor (later rector) of the Berlin Rabbiner Seminar founded by Azriel Hildesheimer. He was also a close colleague of Rabbis 89. Hoffmann, She'elot u-teshovot melamed le-ho 'il, 1:28-29 (entry 29). 90.

Ferziger Hirsch and Ehrentreu, and mentor to Lerner from his student days at the institution in Berlin.92 In my work on Orthodox attitudes toward nonobservance, I examined at length the approach of Hoffmann and concluded that his was a distinctly hierarch ical position that was instrumental in broadening the borders of the Jewish collec tive further than almost all the German Orthodox rabbis of his generation. Simultaneously Hoffmann introduced internal boundaries that distinguished between observant Jews and various types of transgressors. It was noted, further more, that he also divided among the "sinners" themselves, for example, between public Sabbath desecraters and those who were not circumcised. Under prevailing conditions in his time he found the latter's transgression to be a far more acute deviation from normative Jewish identity. In light of this analysis, and especially in view of Hoffmann's relationship to all three main actors in the Hamburg crema tion controversy, it is valuable to explore how Hoffmann addressed the subject of cremation and burial of the ashes. There are three sources to draw from in order to determine Hoffmann's approach to burial of cremation-ashes: a letter responding to Lerner's call for support that was printed in Hayei 'olam and two more expansive rulings published in Hoffmann's own collection, Melammed le-ho 'il. All three, as it turns out, are marked by an ambivalence that seems to reflect both the author's discomfort with adopting a fully exclusionary position and his personal connections to the different sides of the conflict. In point of fact, there is a clear shift in his position over time. In 1903, Hoffmann penned a brief answer to Lerner's query requesting backing for his campaign. The paragraph states that burial of cremation-ashes in a Jewish cemetery should be forbidden in order to prevent the spread of this prac tice (le-migdar miltah). Yet Hoffmann asserts that from a purely legal perspective placement of the ashes "on the side, far from the graves" is allowed. He also main tains that it is wrong to assume that those who ask to be cremated do so out of spite (le-hakh'is) toward Jewish tradition. On the contrary, their motivations are either fear of asphyxiation in the case where those declaring them to be dead were mis taken or hygienic concerns. Finally, Hoffmann encourages the reader to look at his initial discussion of the topic from 1897-98.93 92. For biographical background on Hoffmann, see, e.g., Yeshayahu Aviad-Wolfsberg, "David Hoffmann," in Guardians of Our Heritage, ed. Leo Jung (New York: Bloch, 1958), 361-420; Jonathan M.

Lerner, Hayei 'olam, 101. Like many responsa in Melammed le-ho 'il there is no date listed on the entry. Based on Hoffmann's own testimony in Hayei 'olam, there is no question that it was penned in 1897-1898. 94</page><page sequence="25">Ashes to Outcasts Formally, then, the 1903 letter supports the position of his student Lerner, based on the assumption that the strict approach will curtail the proliferation of cremation among German Jewry. However, the nuances make clear that Hoffmann had a very different perception of the meaning of cremation for Jews of his day. First, he disagrees with the claim that according to Jewish law it was forbidden to inter cremation-ashes. In fact he even notes the solution of Lerner's nemesis, Markus Hirsch (without mentioning him by name)—creating a separate burial area within the Jewish cemetery. Those who respected Hoffmann but retreated from his decisive strategy regarding how to prevent the spread of cremation could find solace in this statement. In addition, by stressing that the cremationists were not necessarily heretically motivated, he undermined Lerner's efforts to transform them into the most hideous of contemporary sinners who were to be completely cast out. These themes are treated in greater detail in Hoffmann's original responsum from 1897-98. Examination of this text only solidifies the sense that despite his agreement with Lerner's practical ruling, the Berlin authority's view of the social and religious import of cremation was thoroughly different. In his discus sion in this responsum, which was written prior to the outbreak of the Hamburg controversy, Hoffmann produces additional legal claims that diverge from Lemer's position. The Berlin rabbi states explicitly that despite the lack of a bib lical burial requirement the ashes still must be concealed (li-genoz) so that people would not transgress the prohibition of gaining benefit from human remains. This was exactly the argument used by Markus Hirsch in his responsum to justify inter ment inside the Hamburg Jewish cemetery. Still, Hoffmann rules that forbidding assignment to the communal burial ground is justified so as not to strengthen the hands of the transgressors. All the same, aware as he was that the "Gaon" Hirsch of Hamburg permitted "placement" (hatmanah) in a separate section, he concludes: "On this it can be said, one cannot compare one place to another, and if in Hamburg there is no apprehension about granting permission... in most places in Germany there is reason to be concerned...therefore it is better not to allow anything, even though according to the law there is no prohibition."94 For Hoffmann, then, the only compelling reason to forbid burial of the ashes was tactical—would it help prevent the spread of cremation and preserve commit ment to traditional Jewish custom? Furthermore, in acknowledging that different factors informed the leaders of every respective Jewish community, he not only expressed his personal respect for Markus Hirsch, but also made clear that he con sidered his colleague's decision to be authoritative for the Jews of Hamburg.95 As such, Hoffmann's reference to this earlier responsum five years later in Hayei 'olam only reinforces the sense of his ambivalence regarding the strident and unequivocal way in which Lerner was advancing his cause. 94. Hoffinann, Melammed le-ho 'il, 2:115 (entry 113, 113-16). 95. See ibid., where he also mentions the position of Great Britain's Nathan Adler and his dependence on a decision of Isaac Elhanan Spektor of Kovno. Hoffmann notes somewhat skeptically, nevertheless, . .although in the [published] collection of the Gaon of Kovno this responsum cannot be found." 95</page><page sequence="26">Adam S. Ferziger By the second decade of the twentieth century Hoffmann went much further, consciously negating his initial pragmatic negative decision, Even though I wrote previously that in order to prevent the spread of this prac tice it is good to decree not to bury the ashes in the cemetery, at this moment I reverse myself.. .for now if we lock the cemetery from the ashes, we have to worry that we will be forced to repeal this pronouncement, and then it will be required to inter the ashes without any distinction at all. Therefore it is best to follow the basic law.96 In 1897-98 and in 1903 as well, Hoffmann saw the semi-inclusive Hamburg approach as an exception and believed that the strict position was still appropriate for most communities. Here, by contrast, he spells out his final acceptance of the Hirsch/Ehrentreu position and rejection of the Lerner outlook as a viable alterna tive for the majority of German Jewry. Without receiving a full explanation, the reader can infer that the stricter strategy had not stood in the way of Jews' adoption of cremation. As the numbers rose, in the eyes of Hoffmann the issue transformed from one of prevention of cremation itself to one of preservation of at least a sym bolic distinction between ideal and grudgingly tolerated behaviors. This could be accomplished most effectively by strengthening the hierarchical solution that allowed for all to be buried in the communal cemetery but strove to establish con crete internal boundaries between the core that had remained loyal to traditional burial and the lower-level "others." This tactical change, it should be emphasized, was achieved relatively smoothly because from the outset Hoffmann had made clear that he disagreed with Lerner in as far as legal reasoning was concerned.97 Thus, even as he altered his bottom-line decision, he did not stray from his initial perception of the fundamental principles of the case. The hierarchical nature of Hoffmann's decision is manifest in a note worthy adjudicatory discussion that at first glance has only limited pragmatic application. Based on a number of sources, he distinguishes between the com munity, which may not necessarily be required to ensure the burial of cremation-ashes, and relatives, who are unequivocally obligated to do so. His reasoning is that the connection and responsibility of family members to inter their deceased kin begins at the moment of death, when the body is still intact and all would agree that burial is required. The community, by contrast, only becomes formally involved at a point at which the corpse has already been trans formed to ashes and the family makes arrangements for interment. At that junc ture the debate as to the need to bury the ashes becomes relevant. All the same, once the family has been compelled to fulfill this role, "we are not permitted to 96. Ibid., 123 (entry 114, 116-24). Once again there is no date, but the discussion references an article published in the Jiidische Presse in 1911. 97. Even as this responsum rejects Lemer's position altogether, Hoffmann's personal respect for his student and his efforts to uphold Jewish tradition is manifest in the Berlin authority's reverential references to Lerner and citations from Hayei 'olam within the text. 96</page><page sequence="27">Ashes to Outcasts lock the cemetery in the face of relatives who wish to bury the ashes and are biblically required to do so."98 From a legal standpoint, this line of reasoning leads to the theoretical con clusion that even if a cremated person is a lifelong member of the community, if no blood relatives accept responsibility for burial then the board would not be required to inter his/her ashes. More broadly, this division between family and com munity has implications regarding underlying matters of Jewish identity as well. Scholars have discussed at length the challenges in the modern Western world to the ethnic-church synthesis that historically characterized Jewish life." Under the fresh circumstances, connection between Jewish collective and religious identities was no longer axiomatic, and numerous secular formulations emerged that dispar aged or at the least were not dependent on a religious element. Yet a sense of "fra ternity" between all born Jews who did not formally reject this bond—that was independent of religious practice or theology—remained intact.100 Hoffmann's legal division implies that a person who asked to be cremated, while not officially becoming an apostate, may have detached him/herself altogether from the ethnic/ communal level of solidarity. What remained was essentially an individual whose ties to both the ethnic and church aspects of Judaism were nearly totally severed. This was unlike Ehrentreu, whose approach, recall, bore similarities to the ethnic outlook articulated in the United States by Hayim Hirshenson. That said, according to Hoffmann the person was still not completely devoid of Jewishness. A bloodline via his/her family existed that ran between the perpe trator of this act and other Jews who were still fully attached to the collective. Minimal and indirect as the tie had become, it was still sufficient to serve as a conduit that would enable burial within the Jewish communal cemetery. The born Jew who chose cremation, then, remained within the Jewish hierarchy but at the lowest possible rung. On a legal level, this distinction between family and community was especially useful and illustrates the depth of Hoffmann's analytical capabilities. Recall that within the discussion above of Ehrentreu's defense of ash-burial, the point was made that if he thought the cremationists also fit under the category of "infants taken captive," why did he nevertheless support burying them in a sep arate section? The Munich rabbi did not supply a clear answer. Hoffmann detected this conundrum; as he put it, "clearly the custom is to bury evildoers, even if they no longer display a single drop of Judaism and have committed transgressions for which the punishment is excommunication ("/caret") or execution by the court." The Berlin authority, as such, was attentive to the logical difficulty of sustaining the internal boundary that separated cremationists from all other modern-day 98.

For a summary discussion, see Daniel Elazar, "Jewish Religious, Ethnic, and National Iden tities: Convergences and Conflicts," in National Variations in Jewish Identity, ed.

Once the vast majority of the most serious sinners were overlooked in the context of the cemetery, why single out the cremationists? His conclusion, nevertheless, was that that they be isolated: "a special area should be assigned for burial of the ashes in order to distinguish.. .between commu nal burial and the interment of individuals ("yehidim") that was not incumbent upon the congregation ("A'a/ja/")."101 In other words, what made cremation different from all other offenses was that it suspended the direct link between the person and the collective. That which remained was an individual, a solitary figure who was allowed inside the confines of the cemetery only because of familial association and not due to any intrinsic quality that he/she possessed. Notwithstanding, Hoff mann's nominal perception of the Jewishness of the cremationists was still more sig nificant than that of Lerner, who refused to allow burial of their ashes altogether and maintained that they "have absolutely no vestige of Judaism left in them."102 Hoffmann brought his discussion to a close by listing operative policies for dealing with cremation-ashes within Jewish communal cemeteries. The vast majority of his directives are nearly identical to those rendered by Markus Hirsch and published in the 1901 work Beit Yisrael. Yet there is one fundamental difference between the two figures that also comes across. According to Hoffmann, In a place where a congregation of God-fearers ("yere'im") establishes their own cemetery, from the start they should decree that cremationists have no place in this burial ground, thus no one [who asks to be cremated] will request to be buried [there]...if it shall happen one time that a person from the congregation of God-fearers shall become contaminated [choose cremation] at the end of life.. .then it will be necessary to give him a place at the periphery of the cemetery.. .In a community in which God-fearers and sinners ("posh'im") are together and the cemetery is the property of the burial society or the entire community, a separate area should be designated for the cremated deceased."103 On one level this split between separatist and united communities reflects Hoffmann's professional obligation to support the policies of his own independent Berlin Adass Jisroel community in which the burial of cremation-ashes was most certainly prohibited. Indeed, Adass Jisroel had established its own cemetery already in 1873 so that its members could be assured that they would be buried in an environment that fully respected traditional practice.104 From another per spective, however, having reversed his previous decision and allowed burial of cremation-ashes, Hoffmann nevertheless saw value in attempting to sustain 101. Hoffmann, Melammed le-ho'il, 2:123. 102. Lerner, "Menuhah nekhonah," 29b. 103. Hoffmann, Melammed le-ho'il, 2:123. 104. The specific impetus was the permission given to inter non-Jewish wives of Jewish members in the main Weissensee communal cemetery. Subsequently, Hoffmann himself gave his impri matur to the Adass Jisroel decision to create its own cemetery. See Die Israelitische Synagogenge meinde (Adass Jisroel) zu Berlin: Ein Riickblick (Berlin: Druck, 1904), 22; Hoffmann, Melammed le-ho'il, 2:133-34, (entry 127). 98</page><page sequence="29">Ashes to Outcasts oases in which the "blight" of cremation was still avoided. Even regarding the separatist cemeteries, however, he contradicted Lerner's enclavist understanding by clarifying that if by chance a communal member did choose cremation and asked to be buried in the cemetery, a distant plot had to be allocated. This multiple-level approach highlights Hoffmann's position as an authority for all German Orthodoxy, and not purely for a specific local community. Simul taneously, it also illustrates the fact that he was personally connected to a separatist framework that was far less diverse than most German Jewish communities and echoes his comment from 1897-98 that "one cannot compare one place to another," which tacitly approved of Markus Hirsch's permissive ruling for Hamburg. Yet, over a decade later, Hoffmann saw the position allowing burial of cremation-ashes to be appropriate for most German communities, while the strict policy once deemed the majority one was now to be limited to a few highly particularistic frameworks. Nonetheless, in Hoffmann's formulation, as opposed to that of Markus Hirsch, the talmudic principle that "evildoers should not be buried next to righteous ones" was preserved formally through the mainten ance of exclusively Orthodox, private cemeteries in which the traditional ideal could be more easily enforced.105 The final result of Hoffmann's latest decision on cremation, then, was the articulation of two parallel types of hierarchical dynamics. One applied to most Jewish cemeteries and sequestered a section for the interred ashes of those who asked to be cremated, one that was to remain separate from the burial places of all other local Jews. The second distinguished between such "integrated" Jewish com munal burial grounds as a whole and exclusively Orthodox ones that were designated for those who remained loyal to Jewish law both in life and in death.106 Thus, even as cremation emerged in the early twentieth century as a definitive symbolic boundary marker for a broader normative Jewish identity, prior distinctions between observant and nonobservant Jews were by no means rendered completely obsolete. Conclusions This paper investigates a major episode in German Jewish religious history that has to date received only peripheral attention. I have sought to demonstrate the ways in which the Hamburg controversy over the burial of cremation-ashes served as a defining moment in the broader theme of German Orthodoxy's ongoing encounter with modern nonobservant Jews. Through a close reading of the legal and ideological statements put forward, the following questions were addressed: how was burial of cremation-ashes viewed by German Jewish rabbinic authorities at the turn of the twentieth century? Why, in the eyes of the Orthodox, did this emerge as the outer 105. B. Sanhedrin 47a; Shulhan 'arukh, Yoreh de'ah 362:5. 106. In Frankfurt, e.g., this partition is literally a visual one, since in the cemetery at Rat-Beil-Strasse that served the local Jews through the early twentieth century, the general communal burial area and that of the Hirschian separatist framework are divided by a large stone wall.

Ferziger boundary marker of Jewish identity at this time? How did cremation differ from pre viously held notions of deviance from religious norms? What new strategies were employed to deal with this behavior? Why was burial, in particular, a seemingly effective and utilitarian vehicle for drawing the margins of the Jewish collective at that time? Among others, parallels were drawn between the positions expressed regarding those who asked to be cremated and those whose nonobservance followed better-known traditional forms that had come to the fore during the same time period in Germany, the Land of Israel, and the United States. No doubt, the battle over burial of cremation-ashes also manifests specific local tensions that emanated from the variant Jewish communal compositions existing side by side in Hamburg and Altona. The distinctive characteristics of each community were reflected in turn by the backgrounds and experiences of those whom they chose as chief rabbis and the brand of Orthodoxy that each promoted. These historical and biographical factors can provide a richer context for appreciating the public dispute.107 The two analytical directions—close textual and phenomenological focus, and contextual understanding—certainly fructify one another and offer the most comprehensive account and interpretation. Yet from a methodological perspec tive I maintain that the latter presentation should follow upon the initial textual analy sis. This aims to mitigate the tendency toward crude deterministic explanations that undermine appreciation for the richness of individual legal and ideological arguments. Epilogue: Frankfurt 1938 A sense of tragedy hovers above any historical study of European Jewry in the late nineteenth [and early twentieth] centwy. Tragedy clings to the subject because the reader knows that the historical path was leading ultimately to the Nazi extermination of the Jews.xoi The symbolic meaning of cremation for German Orthodoxy that has been observed here was transformed dramatically by the catastrophic events that took place in areas controlled by the Nazi government and its allies from the 1930s. Thus imagine my initial surprise when I came across a document in which the two seemingly opposite aspects of cremation and its role in Jewish identity formation converge. Kristallnacht (Night of the Broken Glass) is the name that was given for the infamous events of November 9-10, 1938, when Jewish property was vandalized and hundreds of synagogues destroyed throughout Germany. A fact less well known is that at the time approximately 25,000 German Jews were arrested and sent to concentration camps—Buchenwald, Dachau, and Sachsenhausen. Most were released within weeks or months, but hundreds were killed or died of illness and deprivation during their incarceration. The practice of the Nazis was 107. In order to address these issues properly I have, as noted above, prepared a separate treat ment that was published independently. 108.

Yet he was also cognizant of the relatively recent "legal history" related to cremation and the deep antagonism of all German Orthodox rabbinic figures toward this act. As a matter of fact, Kirschbaum himself had penned a rather ambivalent responsum on burial of cremation-ashes already in 1927, when he still served as a rabbi in Western Galicia. Eerily, he opined at the end of that discussion that "...with God's help [in the future] I will go back and study—no oath taken—this chapter...."112 In the guidelines to the Frankfurt community that he published in 1938 Rabbi Kirschbaum ruled unequivocally that the ashes of the Kristallnacht concentration-camp victims should be placed in a coffin and were certainly deser ving of an honorable Jewish burial.113 Striking, nonetheless, is the fact that in the support that he offered for his decision he created a direct association between this new, tragic Jewish encounter with cremation and precedent from previous debates: This is how the renowned Mateh Levi [Rabbi Mordechai Horowitz] ruled in his letter to our community of June 22nd, 1893 regarding those who were will ingly cremated, surely we rule as such in our case. Similarly he ruled that the ashes of two individuals should not be buried together in one grave.. .and that their graves should be no different than that of any others, certainly the current deceased deserve a proper burial.114 109.

The author reports, on p. 71, that at Buchenwald the S.S. announced over the loudspeaker, "If one of the Jews hangs himself, please write your name on a slip of paper and put it in your pocket so that you can be identified." 110. This procedure continued as late as October 1941. See in Fred Gottlieb, My Childhood in Siegburg, 1929-1938 (Jerusalem: Mazo, 2008), 67, a photograph of the original letter from the operator of the crematorium in Buchenwald, dated October 21, 1941, requesting that the ashes of Mr. Ignaz Rochman be buried in the Siegburg Jewish cemetery. 111.

Yet he still saw fit to cite his well-regarded predeces sor's lenient decision regarding those who were "willingly" cremated in order to buttress his present ruling regarding some of the first Jewish casualties of Nazism. Tragically, after this time Kirschbaum had no more opportunities to revisit this issue. He escaped from Frankfurt to Brussels in 1939 but was eventually deported to Auschwitz and murdered there in the fall of 1942.115 Legalistic discourse such as that described here is predicated on offering pre cedent from similar events, even when their respective contexts are completely different. As a religious adjudicator, then, it was perfectly natural for Kirschbaum to cite earlier sources regarding burial of the ashes of the cremated. When viewed through the eyes of the post-Holocaust Jew, however, such connections between those who chose to have their remains cremated with the masses of Jews who were forcefully dehumanized by the Nazis both in life and after death appears awkward at best, if not offensive. In an age in which the crematoria of Auschwitz have become symbols for innocent suffering and industrialized cruelty,116 raising parallels between the victims and those who were deemed by many to be undeser ving of the most minimal honor, strikes a nerve. Such ambivalence was expressed by the scholar and bibliographer Rabbi Solomon Joseph Zevin (1885-1978) in 1959 when summarizing Kirschbaum's statutes. Diverging openly from his usual practice of critiquing a work that he had described, he declared: "Regarding some of these statutes there may be room to debate from the perspective of the halakhah, but—'remove your sandals from your feet, for the place on which you stand is holy ground' (Exodus 3:5)."117 Without losing sight of the delicate nature of the subject, in the context of the current paper the linkage between the turn-of-the-twentieth-century burial contro versy and the Holocaust nonetheless highlights the ongoing role of cremation in twentieth-century Jewish identity formation. If early on it served as an outer boundary or hierarchical marker, after the Holocaust ironically it emerged anew as an unfortunate symbol of elemental inclusion in the Israelite collective.118 Adam S.

The author emphasizes the variety of ways— both direct and indirect—that Jewish historical scholarship since 1945 has been influenced by the Holo caust. Reading this just as I was reaching the concluding phases of preparing the current article, I found myself pondering the degree to which my initial interest in earlier Jewish debates surrounding crema tion was piqued by its subsequent symbolic meaning within Holocaust memory. 102</page></plain_text>
