Since 1983, however, not less than four have appeared, in addition to a collective volume, a host of articles, and sections within books devoted to larger subjects. Three basic considerations seem to have prompted this outpouring: Viennese Jewry's legendary contribution to modern culture; its equally legendary degree of assimilation; and the character of Viennese anti-Semitism. Marsha Rozenblitt's The Jews of Vienna, 1867-1914: Assimilation and Identity (1983) concentrated on the community, not the intellectual elite, using demographic findings to show the persistence of social cohesion. George E. Berkly, a political scientist, in a popular, richly anecdotal history, Vienna and Its Jews: The Tragedy of Suc- cess, 1880s-1980s (1988), chose to focus on why Jews loved Vienna as much as they did, and why popular anti-Semitism was more prevalent among Austrians than Germans. Robert Wistrich, in his thick and solidly researched The Jews of Vienna in the Age of Franz Joseph (1989), produced the broadest volume of this literature. His concern was with all three ele- ments: the community, with its conflicting ideologies, the productivity of the Jewish cultural elite, and the nature of Austrian anti-Semitism. Steven Beller, in the most challenging of all the recent volumes, focuses on those few Viennese Jews who were major contributors to modern culture. Despite its title, this doctoral dissertation is not a cultural history-at least not in the narrative, chronological sense. Neither the biographies of the major figures nor their major works are Beller's subject-except insofar as they contribute to a thesis. It is that intriguing, complex, and controversial thesis which is the heart of his book. Beller's starting point is Carl Schorske's influential hypothesis that the remarkable vitality of fin-de-siecle Viennese culture is best explained as the product of a disempowered liberal bourgeoisie that eventually imitated the aestheticism of the aristocracy. The Jewish issue, for Schorske, is not deter- minative. Although Beller is careful to qualify each individual argument, his contention is precisely the opposite: Viennese high culture around 1900 was essentially Jewish culture-provided we are prepared to understand that designation according to criteria and components which Beller seeks to define and illustrate. Beller's initial objective is simply to show that the leading figures were indeed Jews and that the educated, liberal bourgoisie, the social base of cul- tural innovation, was preponderantly Jewish. He does this first by adducing the principal names for each of the fields of cultural endeavor, showing that, with the exception of the plastic arts, Jews dominated in each one. Then,</page><page sequence="3">238 BOOK REVIEWS especially on the basis of statistical data regarding Gymnasium education, he concludes that Jews represented as much as two-thirds of the educated, liberal class. The remainder and bulk of the volume is an attempt to explain this dis- proportion, and it is here that Beller's work raises some serious questions. To begin with, he includes as Jewish-without apparent differentiation- anyone who was Jewish by descent, even if the percentage was as little as one quarter (Hugo von Hofmannsthal) and even if that individual had utterly renounced Judaism to the point of giving it a wholly negative and mythical character (Otto Weininger). Granted that the confrontation with anti- Semitism, because it alienates, may be a factor in creativity, and that the convert or child of converts may still experience it. But Beller goes further. He wants to show that elements of Jewish tradition and of the Jewish experi- ence in modernity also played a significant role, even among apostates, making no distinction between an identifying Jew whose Jewishness was clearly apparent in his work, like Richard Beer-Hofmann, and individuals like Karl Kraus and Ludwig Wittgenstein, who were both Christian. In fact, Beller argues-ignoring in this regard figures like Moses Mendelssohn and Martin Buber-that Jews who had a traditional religious upbringing and rejected assimilation were not likely to become significant European figures. What made the important Viennese figures Jewish, other than their descent, Beller believes, was first of all the traditional Jewish attachment to educa- tion, regardless of the transfer of that attachment from sacred to secular spheres. There was also a second element: the Jewish stress on ethical responsibility, which enabled Jews to withstand the seductions of Viennese aestheticism. That element is unquestionably present in Jewish tradition, though it is linked to a broader conception of response to God and is cer- tainly not an "ethics of individualism." I find Beller least convincing when he further argues for the existence of a "Jewish stoicism," which, though he has a source for it, I find characteristic neither of traditional nor of modern Jewish consciousness. Jewish messianism contradicts it. Beller's strongest argument for a common ethos among the Viennese cultural elite rests upon the commitment to ethics and truth as opposed to aesthetics, an idea from the tradition which fit in well with German clas- sicism and came to distinguish this preponderantly-though not wholly- Jewish group. Its consequence was a lasting and increasingly isolating attachment to the liberal values of the German Enlightenment, especially the universalism of Schiller (which Beller stresses) and the ethicism of Kant</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 239 (which he might have stressed more). Vienna at the turn of the century was not hospitable to this combination of vestigial Jewish and German classical elements. Its own popular culture was more sensuous than ethically serious, more given to Gemiitlichkeit than intellectual innovation. The work of Freud or Kraus, Beller notes tellingly, was "nothing other than a culture produced against its Viennese environment." What Vienna supplied, it seems, was, above all, alienation. This ambitious book is worthy of the most serious consideration. In a sophisticated discussion, remarkable for a beginning scholar, it raises the fundamental issues of defining the limits of "Jewish" in modern cultura creativity and of explaining such creativity by Jews in relation to their origins. Beller's answers may not be wholly persuasive, but they are eminently worthy of reflection. Michael A. Meyer Hebrew Union College Cincinnati, Ohio</page></plain_text>
