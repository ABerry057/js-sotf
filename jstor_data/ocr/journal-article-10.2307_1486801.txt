<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Emanuel, Tov. The Textual Criticism of the Bible.- An Introduction. Jerusa- lem: Mossad Bialik, 1989. xxiv, 326 pp. (Hebrew). The lower textual criticism of the Hebrew Bible, by which we refer to the attempt to determine the correct text, is a subject with a long history. Its ear- liest beginnings are in the attempt of the scribes of antiquity to preserve and pass on the biblical writings to us, culminating in the great Masoretic collec- tions of notes and lists which were intended to guard the accuracy of the authoritative, sacred text. In the modern period, serious textual criticism revolved around two separate poles: the investigation of Hebrew biblical manuscripts from the Middle Ages, and the use of ancient biblical translations (the versions) to attempt to correct or emend the received, Masoretic text. Most textual cri- tics assumed that they would be able to recover an Urtext, the original Hebrew text of Scripture. It soon became clear that medieval Hebrew biblical manuscripts held lit- tle in the way of evidence for ancient biblical variants. But the study of the versions and their use for textual emendation was unabated. In fact, much of this emendation ignored the history of the text of the versions themselves, therefore confusing scribal errors or exegetical variants with genuine evi- dence for the Hebrew biblical text. The development of this field within the discipline of modern biblical studies has been revolutionized by the discovery of biblical manuscripts at 103</page><page sequence="2">104 BOOK REVIEWS Qumran, Masada, and Nalhal Hever. It is in the context of these new dis- coveries and with the benefit of their important evidence that Emanuel Tov has written his Biqqoret Nusa. Ha-Miqra'. This volume is an introduction, better a prolegomenon, to the pursuit of textual criticism of the Bible. Tov presents readers, in carefully outlined handbook form, the back- ground information they need to deal with lower text-critical issues. The organization of the book, including bibliographies for each section and numerous examples to illustrate each point, makes this an excellent text- book. Tov carefully discusses the nature of the textual evidence and manu- scripts of the Hebrew Bible, the ancient translations, and the history of the biblical text. He then surveys the manner in which the text was transmitted, dealing with scribes and scribal techniques. On this basis he turns more di- rectly to textual criticism itself, indicating the specific criteria based on which readings are to be evaluated. He then deals with the relationship be- tween textual and literary criticism, as well as with the process of textual emendation. He concludes with an evaluation of critical editions of the Hebrew Bible available or in prepartion at present. While this volume is intended specifically to provide readers with the background for undertaking their own text-critical scholarship, the book is a goldmine for those seeking to study the history of the biblical text in late antiquity. Nowhere else can you find such a thorough presentation of how the Bible was transmitted in Second Temple times. From this point of view it should be required reading for all scholars of Bible, Second Temple, and rabbinic literature. Accordingly, its planned publication in an English edi- tion is most welcome. Yet this reviewer cannot help but treat the book from a somewhat differ- ent perspective, as the first volume to synthesize the evidence for the history of the biblical text found at Qumran. While Tov did not have access to all the Qumran biblical scrolls, he utilized a sufficient number, including some unpublished materials, to allow for valid general evaluation. One of the most central conclusions of Tov's work for scholars of Judai- ca is that the proto-Masoretic text form was indeed the dominant form in the Qumran collection. This conclusion means that the process of standardi- zation already known from rabbinic sources and elsewhere must have been operating in the Hasmonean period. Throughout the book, Tov sees the MT as the oldest and most accurate form of the text. Yet the Qumran evidence highlights a basic contradiction which emerges in reading this book. Textual criticism had set as its goal the determination</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 105 of the correct text of Scripture. It is now clear that the Qumran evidence indicates the coexistence of varied texts. The scribes who copied these texts must have had very different ideas of what textual accuracy means than did the later rabbis. Accordingly, and as the book shows over and over, our evi- dence allows us to study the nature of the biblical texts transmitted in late antiquity and to analyze the manner in which these texts came about, their relationship one to another, and the place of the various textual witnesses in the history of Judaism. We can never expect to determine, based on this evi- dence, what the original text was. Because the field of textual criticism is itself in transition, it is not surprising to find that Tov's presentation reflects the same ambiguity. This excellently written handbook represents a major step forward for biblical studies, since it integrates the new evidence from the caves of the Judean Desert with the results of studies by the author and others based on the previously available evidence of the MT, the versions, rabbinic litera- ture, and other sources. Accordingly, the author is correct when he asserts that the book sets forth a completely new approach to textual criticism. For readers of this journal, the textual criticism of the Bible as it was transmitted in Second Temple times must now take its place among the areas of research which have contributed so much to the study of Judaism in late antiquity.
