<plain_text><page sequence="1">EDITOR'S NOTE When this journal was founded seven years ago, hopes were expressed as to the nature of the material that would be published. It soon became appar- ent that the question was not what was to appear but whether indeed the publication would continue to appear at all. AJSreview proceeded to follow a pattern classic for periodicals of its kind. As has frequently been noted, scholarly journals often begin with a deceptively large amount of material which then becomes progressively more modest. After two or three years, the publication may enter a critical period in which the very question of its survival is at stake. In my last year as editor, I made every effort to restore AJSreview to its initial format in terms of both quality and quantity. Although for technical reasons, the present volume has been published as a double volume, it does actually contain one year's worth of material. It is then a clear fulfillment of my hopes and serves as evidence that the future of this publication is no longer in doubt. Now that this goal has been achieved, it is time for me, as founding editor, to make way for those with a new vision that will lead the journal on new paths. It remains then only to thank those who have been of so much help throughout the years. Since the time that Dagnija Karklins came to the Department of Near Eastern Studies of the University of Toronto, my task as editor of AJSreview and of two volumes of conference proceedings has been lightened in numer- ous ways. Although it was not at all a formal part of her duties, she willingly and cheerfully assumed many administrative tasks which were of great bene- fit to me. A number of close friends and associates have brought their special skills to bear on the production of this journal. Susan Cohen, James Diamond, Imogene Friedman, Libby Garshowitz, Adina Liberles and Barry Walfish worked with great dedication, often under pressure and at consider- able personal inconvenience. May this statement serve as a modest expres- sion of my appreciation. To all who served as members of the Editorial Advisory Board and to all the many readers who were called upon to assist over the years, I offer a pro- found expression of thanks. To the contributors to AJSreview, I express my appreciation for their courtesy and cooperation. Many real friendships developed from associations begun or continued in the context of this jour- nal. It is this, if anything, which has made it all worthwhile. XIII</page></plain_text>
