Jeruisalem: Bar-Ilan University, 1983. 283 pp. In the course of the last twenty years, messianic activism has returned to the stage of Jewish history with a fury. The Israeli victory in the Six-Day War, bringing with it the conquest of important parcels of the biblical home- land, infused new meaning into the redemptive expectations which have accompanied Jews throughout their history. Indeed, the "restoration" of</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 283 Judea and Samaria, and more generally, the exhilarating assertion of Jewish power, have spurred on activist circles who, somewhat ironically, believe that their willful exertions are but the fulfillment of conditions prerequisite to the Coming of the Days. The same events of the last twenty years have also influenced the realm of Jewish scholarship. To be sure, scholars have not joined the ranks of the activists en masse (individual exceptions notwithstanding). Yet a novel mode of scholarly discourse has emerged out of the dizzying events of 1967, out of the bold assertion of Jewish power. This new discourse is marked by a sen- sitivity to manifestations of concrete political power in the Jewish past, and thus can be seen as reactive (and corrective) to the widespread perception in modern Jewish (and especially Zionist) thought that powerlessness and poli- tical ineptitude were universal conditions of Jewish existence in the dias- pora. (See, for example, the work of Daniel Elazar and Stuart Cohen, and most recently, David Biale's essay "Power and Powerlessness in Jewish History.") Indeed, it seems that as the concern with Jewish power in the present increases, so does the search for Jewish power in the past intensify. Gerald J. Blidstein's 'Ekronot Mediniyim Be-Mishnat Ha-Rambam par- ticipates in the current "discourse of power." The point of this observation is to underscore the topicality of Blidstein's subject and to suggest that his treatment can be seen within the context of the discourse of power. It is not to say that Blidstein undertakes to rationalize current messianic activism, as some have, on the basis of a reading of Maimonides; nor is it to deny the scholarly merit of Blidstein's presentation. Professor Blidstein offers in his study a much-needed close reading of the last section of the last book of Maimonides' Mishneh Torah, namely, the Laws of Kings and Their Wars (Hilkhot Melakhim). As part of a monumen- tal halakhic code, the Laws of Kings and Their Wars is a collection of tersely formulated legal principles intended to establish normative guidelines for communal and individual behavior. However, in that these principles deal with a subject-Jewish kingship and the messianic era-not realized in the political world of Maimonides' time, they invite an examination into the theoretical and personal motives behind their inclusion. After all, what was the practical value for the Jewish contemporary of Maimonides in learning about the separation of functions between priest, prophet, and king, or the regulations concerning the proper honor to be accorded a king? Were not such matters irrelevant to, if not disruptive of, the rhythm of ritual life fol- lowed by diaspora Jews? One overarching response to these questions points to the normative</page><page sequence="3">284 BOOK REVIEWS function which the Mishneh Torah was intended to play for the Jewish com- munity. That is, as a work of codification, it sought to establish juridical standards valid and applicable for all historical time-including both the aberrational period of exile (in which the Mishneh Torah was produced) and the period in which Israel would return to its homeland. This, at least, is the frame of reference given by Professor Blidstein, who follows the position staked out by Isadore Twersky in his various writings on the Mishneh Torah. On this view, the codificatory work of Maimonides comes not as a bold attempt to supplant the Talmud as the authoritative source of Jewish law; nor, as has been suggested by some, is it intended primarily to serve as the constitution of a future messianic state. Rather, the Mishneh Torah reflects in all its parts the exacting labor of a jurist operating consistently, though creatively, within the boundaries of halakhic discourse (Blidstein, p. 13). In exploring the tension in Maimonides between consistency and creativ- ity, which is nowhere so great as in the difficult matter of messianism, Blid- stein argues against the explanation of Maimondean eschatology offered by Gershom &gt;Scholem. Accordingly, the inclusion of the chapters on messianism in Hilkhot Melakhim was not a "surrender to convention" (p. 16). Rather, it reflected a legitimate and sincere attempt to regulate a vitally important component of the halakhic system. Indeed, for Blidstein, the messianic vision "appears as the realization of the ideal social impulse in Israel, and as an essential component of the halakhic corpus portrayed in the Mishneh Torah." Though perhaps one of the most interesting and controversial parts of Maimonides' codificatory endeavors, the messianic chapters of Hilkhot Melakhim are not Blidstein's exclusive concern; for they represent the cul- mination, but not the entirety, of Jewish political activity. Most of Blid- stein's study is devoted to an analysis of the mechanism of kingship, its structure, authority, and the ritual surrounding it. In this area, Blidstein has made perhaps his most important contribution. Indeed, his meticulous examination of the earlier Jewish sources which fed Maimonides' views on kingship demonstrates an impressive command of biblical and rabbinic material. Blidstein's comprehensive dissection of the Law of Kings exposes the bold sweep (and structure) of an important aspect of Maimonides' halakhic thought. Without a doubt, his study has significantly elevated the level of scholarly discourse, surpassing previous work (see, for example, Schwarzfuchs, Revue des itudesjuives 111 [1951-52]) which addressed these most enigmatic chapters of Maimonidean halakhah.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 285 My primary interest here, however, is not the analysis of rabbinic sources (about which I can make no claim to expertise). Rather, it lies in the understanding of politics operative throughout Blidstein's book-namely, politics as the guarantor of social stability. Blidstein points out the para- mount importance of this principle in Maimonides' treatment of royal suc- cession and inheritance (HM I:7-9). Passing on royal authority from father to son allows for the peaceful and continuous maintenance of order; it does not necessarily entail, however, popular affirmation of the transmission process. On the contrary, it specifically excludes popular participation, which, Blidstein notes, was a central motif of Maimonides' historical justifi- cation of kingship (cf. Blidstein, chap. 1 and pp. 158-160). Moreover, Blid- stein observes that Maimonides even justifies the authority of sovereigns whose initial or subsequent claims to power were in some way flawed (HM 11:3 and Blidstein, pp. 43-44). Thus it appears that, according to Mai- monidean halakhah, the principle of power attained by a sovereign through any number of unconventional or illegal means decisively overrides the vaguely defined (though theoretically desirable) principle of popular con- sent. In other words, order takes precedence over the process meant to achieve it. According to Blidstein, the premium Maimonides placed on stability and order was also evident in the primary functions he ascribed to royal authority. Ensuring justice and waging war, two tasks rooted in biblical kingship (I Sam. 8:19-20), were central priorities in Maimonides' monar- chic scheme; both, after all, stemmed from a single impulse-to preserve order, whether from internal or external threat. And both were reflective of wh.at Blidstein calls the "political realist" perspective embodied in Mai- monidean halakhah (pp. 43, 178). One can surmise that this designation mirrors Blidstein's own interest in Maimonidean "politics." That is, Blidstein's focus is on the mechanics of the political processes and institutions leading up to the messianic era as described in Hilkhot Melakhim. To move beyond these processes and insti- tutions is, for him, to move beyond politics. And because its concern is politics, defined as the practical art of governance, Blidstein's analysis neces- sarily remains a structural analysis of Jewish political institutions in his- torical time (taken to include the messianic days). This "mundane" view of politics which guides Blidstein's consideration of Maimonidean halakhah significantly differs from the exalted vision of politics which animates Leo Strauss's classic studies of Maimonidean</page><page sequence="5">286 BOOK REVIEWS philosophy. For Strauss, politics is the science whose concern is prophecy. And prophecy "distinguishes itself from merely political leadership in that its purpose is not, like the latter's, merely the well-being of the body, the health of the world of the senses, but also the perfection of the intellect, the proper perfection of man" (Philosophy and Law, p. 102). Here then politics is not reducible to the mechanics of mundane governance, but rather describes the activity of the ideal personality (the prophet) in whom bodily and theoretical perfection conjoin. The contrast between Blidstein's mundane conception of politics and what may be called Strauss's haute politique yields some interesting conse- quences. While the latter view holds that it is the Platonic understanding of "politics" which resonates most powerfully for Maimonides (and other medieval Jewish and Islamic philosphers), the former resists appeal to sources outside of the Jewish tradition. Indeed, one of the least gratifying areas of Blidstein's study is his analysis of non-Jewish sources. In consider- ing Maimonides' notion of kingship, Blidstein acknowledges that "the Tal- mud may have been influenced by the phenomenon of a Hellenistic monarchy" (p. 205). His brief discussion mentions some of the possible areas of influence, though it quickly and characteristically concludes with a reiteration of Maimonides' reliance on biblical and talmudic sources. More significantly, Blidstein consistently minimizes, without offering adequate explanation, the importance of contemporary Islamic models for Mai- monides' thought (see p. 20, n. 3). In the case of monarchic inheritance, for example, Blidstein cursorily dismisses the possible influence on Maimonides of the debate in Islam over hereditary transmission of the caliphate (p. 39, n. 91). He does make a more substantial case in comparing the Islamic jihad to various aspects of the Jewish notion of war. In fact, Blidstein suggests a cer- tain similarity in their psychological justification-namely, the promise to those who are going to fight that they will attain a place in paradise. However, beyond that common psychological motive, the balance of Blid- stein's comparison between Islamic and Jewish models leans rather pre- dictably to the side of differences (pp. 234-242). What is clear from these cases, as well as from the critical apparatus, is that Blidstein has canvassed the scholarly literature concerning Islamic poli- tical institutions and theory. What is less clear is how he has applied this literature to his own subject. Indeed, Blidstein's references to outside sources serve as tantalizing intimations of their possible influence on certain Maimonidean principles. Unfortunately, the lead is rarely followed</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 287 through. More commonly, Blidstein escorts us back to the pristine Jewish sources for an explanation. In part, this is the result of the author's admira- ble recognition of his own limits; in introducing the book, Blidstein re- nounces any claim to competency in medieval Arabic sources (p. 16). He recognizes the accomplishments of modern scholars (Strauss, Pines, and Berman) in drawing out the Muslim influences in Maimonidean philosophy; at the same time he affirms his own interest in Maimonides as a halakhist (and an extraordinarily gifted one) operating within the confines of the rab- binic tradition. However, not only does this implicit distinction between Maimonidean philosophy and Maimonidean halakhah (and their respective sources) run counter to Blidstein's later statement concerning kingship that "there is no significant contradiction beween the philosophic and halakhic discussions, although there are substantial differences in emphasis" (p. 93). It makes perplexing and ironic Blidstein's efforts, against his own warnings, to ascertain the absence of external influence (e.g., in the case of inheritance) reflected in Maimonidean halakhah. And yet, it may well be that the limited appeal to outside sources goes hand in hand with the scope of politics outlined in Blidstein's analysis of Hilkhot Melakhim. For indeed the scope of politics contemplated by Blid- stein seems to correspond to the subject matter of his study, halakhah. Although Blidstein contends that genre differences (most importantly, halakhic vs. philosophic) do not yield profound substantive differences, the definition of politics which he arrives at seems to be dictated by the limits of the halakhic framework. Thus, in contrast to Strauss's philosophic reading (in which politics is "the end and the conclusion, the crowning and seal, if one will, of metaphysics"), Blidstein's treatment rarely leaves the solid ground of institutional conduct and efficacy for the ethereal reaches of spiri- tual or theoretical perfection. Universal redemption and individual perfec- tion, which concerned medieval Islamic and Jewish philosophy, are not the concerns of this politics; communal regulation, reliant upon and consistent with halakhah, is. On this view, Jewish sources more than adequately satisfy Maimonides' needs in Hilkhot Melakhim. Given the presence of the mundane version of politics throughout Blid- stein's treatment, one final matter remains to be discussed, what I shall call the "normative/transformative" tension. The problem arises out of the dis- cussion of kingship, an institution whose reestablishment is vital to the whole messianic process. Blidstein asserts that "Maimonides saw kingship (and authority in general) as a means and not an end in itself," namely, as</page><page sequence="7">288 BOOK REVIEWS instrumental to spiritual fulfillment (p. 258). Yet he also implies that, within the lower realm of the political, Maimonides grants an extraordinary amount of authority to the sovereign ruler. This, of course, was adumbrated in Maimonides' justification of regimes which attain power illegally. It also was hinted at in Maimonides' inordinate concern for the honor to be accorded a king by his subjects (pp. 197-213). In both cases, Maimonides is motivated by a strong desire to ensure communal stability; most efficacious to that task is a strong centralized authority, control of which is passed on hereditarily. As against the principle of monarchic authority stands the supreme force of Torah. Blidstein notes that for Maimonides, "performing a command- ment is preferable . .. to following the will of the king" (p. 207). A wise and pious king should not allow his reign to interfere with the observance of commandments; on the contrary, he should recognize the instrumental quality of the political stability which his regime aims to engender-as a "mere" prerequisite to the spiritual elevation of the community and its individual members. Still, we recall that Blidstein's focus lies not in messianic fulfillment, but in the political processes leading up to it. It is quite interesting then that he presents at the end of his book a number of hypothetical situations which call attention to the strain between monarchic and religious authority. First, Blidstein points out an irony in Maimonidean halakhah, whose roots he traces to talmudic sources: a "rebel" against kingly authority-even one who rejects a monarchic demand as illegal on religious grounds-is judged by none other than the king himself. Second, an order which transgresses a law of the Torah is invalid only as it relates to the order itself, but not as it relates to the authority of a king who issued it (p. 263). Blidstein observes that the halakhic system fails to establish sufficient guidelines for dealing with these extraordinary situations. Indeed, one of the greatest of all hala- khic authorities, Maimonides, apparently did not succeed in fully reconcil- ing the competing demands of political stability and religious propriety (p. 196). For it appears that the standing of one who rebels against the king because of the latter's religious transgressions is upheld on religious, but not on political, grounds. After all, responsibility for punishing the rebel remains with the king. Conversely, the king's standing after issuing a hala- khically invalid order is diminished on religious, but apparently not on political, terms.</page><page sequence="8">BOOK REVIEWS 289 Ultimately, the tension between the normative authority and transfor- mative potential of a king parallels the central tension of Maimonidean eschatology, ie., that tension which stems from the simultaneous impulses to include and restrain messianism within a halakhic framework. Indeed, revealed in this tension are the dual aims of law-as utopian ideal and as "nomos," a set of conflicting sensibilities which, as social beings, we are con- tinually hoping to reconcile. (See on this matter the provocative work of the legal scholar Robert Cover, whose recent tragic death cut off a brilliant and all too brief career.) Blidstein addresses this tension, in a chapter entitled "Norm and Redemption," by discussing the various sources and motives of Maimonides' utterances on messianism. This multisource appeal yields an equivocal response to the normative/transformative question, though Blid- stein observes that the ambiguity stems from Maimonides' own failure to make clear the nexus between his messianic and normative halakhic visions (p. 252). And to be sure, what Maimonides fails to illuminate, Blidstein's analysis does not resolve. Given the limited scope of Blidstein's mundane politics, it is hard to imagine how it could. For, according to his reading, the realm of politics is confined to the search for orderly communal governance; it never extends directly into the area of individual or collective spiritual fulfillment. The failure to resolve the normative/transformative dilemma is not Blidstein's alone. On the contrary, this dilemma has informed Jewish com- munal life for as long as the aspiration for a more perfect society has existed. Ironically, with the reification of Jewish power in the form of the State of Israel, that aspiration, far from abating, has become even more intense. In fact, the assertion of power has highlighted the rift between normative and transformative impulses in contemporary Jewish thought: for on one hand, it has stimulated an enormously repercussive messianic activism among cer- tain segments of the Jewish population; and on the other, it has lent new interest and meaning to expressions of a prosaic "politics" in the Jewish past. In our own case, the topicality of Jewish power and, more specifically, of messianic activism has rendered the type of politics discussed by Profesor Blidstein worthy and relevant within the context of modern Jewish and Israeli culture. Despite the built-in limitations of this conception, Blidstein has, through his meticulous research, shed light on the mechanisms of political authority envisioned by Maimonides in a Jewish kingship. More important-</page><page sequence="9">290 BOOK REVIEWS ly, he has brought to our awareness an enduring tension which attends not only Jewish history, but human society at large-that between the norma- tive and transformative impulses embodied in the notion of law.
