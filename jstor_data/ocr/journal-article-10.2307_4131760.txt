<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ahuva Belkin. The Purimshpil, Studies in Jewish Folk Theater. Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, 2002. 287 pp. (Hebrew). In the Early Modem period, the Jewish people did not develop theater arts comparable to that of other cultures. One reason often given to explain this absence of theatrical tradition is the virulent denunciations of theater by the rabbis, who likened it to idolatry and heresy, and condemned it as being incompatible with monotheism. The biblical injunction (Ps. 1:1): "Blessed is the man that sits not in the seat of the scornful" has often been cited as condemning the theater, interpreting the Hebrew word lezim, not as mocking or impious, but as buffoon or jester, and by extension, actor. Ahuva Belkin attempts to explain this cultural fact while at the same time challenging the argument that Jews did not create any theatrical tradi- tion. From the Middle Ages on, Ashkenazi society produced many forms of popu- lar entertainment, the most accomplished of which was the Purim-shpil. Belkin's work, which makes use of the pioneering studies of Yiddish theater by B. Gorin, Y. Shatsky, I. Shipper, and Ch. Shmeruk, offers much new and original material. Unlike some historians, for whom Purim plays had no artistic value, she re- minds us to what extent these plays offer a privileged access to many fundamen- tal aspects of Ashkenazi culture. The vernacular language, more than Hebrew, became a space for linguistic creation, social criticism and a questioning of val- ues. Using different methods of investigation, Belkin reveals the complexity, di- versity, and plasticity of the Purim-shpil, with reference to the social history of the Jews, the sociology of Ashkenazi culture, the history of art forms and cultural transfers between Jewish society, and the surrounding societies. Above all, she opens the study of the Purim-shpil to a multitude of domains, including the histo- ry of mentalities, the anthropology of Ashkenazi culture, comparative history of theatrical traditions in Europe, and the theory of literary forms. Tracing the his- toric evolution of the Purim-shpil, whose oldest written source goes back only as far 1697, she presents the theatrical genre as a fusion of disparate elements from different eras. She retraces its emergence and evolution from ancient improvisa- tions on the jubilation following the hanging of Haman, as well as from medieval parodies of derashot and burlesque sketches on daily life in Jewish communities. From an anthropological viewpoint, (J.G. Frazer, A. van Genep, V Turner) the Purim-shpil tradition is likened to a rite of passage connected with the change of sea- sons and the carnival-like transgressions that accompany it. Although related to the reading of the Scroll of Esther in the synagogue, Purim time remains an occasion for 404</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews a cluster of rituals and practices concerned with social contention, the breaking of taboos and the portrayal of a topsy-turvy world. The author analyzes the complex di- alectic that exists between respect and transgression: respect of religious themes and codes concerning the reading of the Book of Esther and the transgressions evident in parody, laughter, social criticism, and carnival-like inversion. Based on the studies of M. Bakhtin, the author defines the characteristic features of popular Jewish culture relative to oral forms, insults, obscenity, the corporal, and the grotesque. She analyzes the poetic forms used in festive reversal, including parodies of sacred texts, wordplay, burlesque monologues, and verbal-sparring matches. The texts play on the clash be- tween the most extreme elements of Jewish culture: sacred and transgression, pure and impure, high culture in Hebrew, and popular culture in Yiddish. The political and social dimensions are also of great importance. Theatrical performances offer an out- let for passions, conflicts, and social frustrations, as shown in the diatribes against the learned and the rich, against rabbis and community leaders. With the denunciation of Haman inspired by the Targum Sheni, Purim also affords an occasion to target anti- Jewish stereotypes circulated by Christians and to reappropriate them, the better to combat them and stigmatize their irrational aspect. The work contains a great deal of information about the actors, staging, and conditions of the performances. There were some professional actors, but for the most part, the plays were written and acted by cantors and yeshivah students, craftsmen, or ordinary householders. They were presented either in private homes or on an impro- vised stage in a public place. The author goes beyond the borders of Jewish culture, using a comparative approach to illustrate the phenomena of cultural permeability. She shows how the Purim-shpil was influenced by the celebrations and theatrical gen- res of the surrounding societies, in particular such forms as the Comedia dell'arte and the biblical dramas of the Christian world. Belkin presents a universal grammar of theatrical forms linked to carnival and celebration, many ingredients of which we find in the tradition of the Purim-shpil. The eighteenth century saw the gradual de- cline of Purim plays and the birth of modern theater, which began to be recognized and respectable, while still plunging its roots in the themes, characters, and writing of the Purim-shpil. The work of Itzik Manger, evoked at the end of the book, bears witness to the existence of a tradition that went through multiple mutations and, in every era, nourished the Jewish imagination. Belkin has produced a scholarly, origi- nal, and innovative work which, beginning with an exhaustive study of the Purim- shpil, shows the modernity of popular forms of Ashkenazi culture.
