<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW ESSAY ANDALUSIAN TYPES OF AMBIGUITY by TOVA ROSEN Ross Brann. The Compunctious Poet: Cultural Ambiguity and Hebrew Poetry in Muslim Spain. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1991. xiii, 228 pp. When dealing with Andalusian Hebrew poetry in the Golden Age, the issue of the cultural identity of the poets and their milieu is crucial and unavoidable. How did the poets themselves approach the question of their identity? What was their attitude toward their art? How did they view themselves vis-h-vis the dominant Arabic culture? How did they manage to maintain their Judaism and Hebraism alongside (or despite?) their arabicized social manners and literary mannerisms? Is it possible to reconcile their orthodox (and at times even extremely mystical and ascetic) attitudes with their hedonistic and affectionate attachment to worldly vanities? How deep were their religious convictions? Or else, how authentic were their secular expressions? How are we to understand their sincere spiritual message in the face of their preoccupation with aestheticism and superficial formalism? Answers to these and to similar questions are vital in the attempt to reconstruct the mentality of the Spanish Hebrew poet. As Ross Brann maintains in the first chapter of his new book, "apologetic and ideological tendencies have ... clouded research into Andalusian Hebrew poetry ever since it achieved a place of honor in the 'civilized' canon of nineteenth-century Jewish scholarship" (p. 16). The multifaceted portrait of the Spanish Hebrew poet was indeed anachronistically exploited by modem critics and scholars to illustrate issues inherent to modem, often extraliterary, polemics. The medieval poet was often seen as a prototype of the ideal modem Jew. For some he served as an early example of the new secular Jew, concerned with aesthetics, nature, love, and existential questions. For 273</page><page sequence="2">274 TOVA ROSEN others he represented a well-balanced synthesis between national-religious Jewish preoccupations and universal human concerns. For assimilationists, the Golden Age served as a historical precedent for the possibility of a full-fledged Jewish life in diaspora, while for Zionists the decline of the Golden Age testified to the instability and insecurity of Jewish life and culture in exile. Individual figures were selectively chosen as precursors of modem phenomena (e.g., Shmuel ha-Nagid was depicted as the first Jewish soldier in postbiblical times, Judah ha-Levi, the first Zionist, etc.). For Hebraists, the revival of Hebrew as a literary language in Spain served as an encouraging example for the renaissance of Hebrew literature. Even the likelihood of coexistence between Jews and Arabs in the Middle East today is often supported, in current political controversies, by the idealized Andalusian example. The reaction to these highly ideologically-charged orientations was, in the last decades, the cultivation of purely literary (textual, aesthetical, structural, comparative, etc.) approaches to the medieval Hebrew poetry. Brann's laudable enterprise combines an insightful literary discussion with wider cultural and intellectual outlooks. Free from any external ideological commitments, he offers a fresh and original angle to the understanding of the unique conciousness and sensitivities of the Andalusian Hebrew poets. In Brann's discussion, the idealized, harmonious portrait of the Andalusian poet in whom all varied interests, attachments, and convictions abide together in full and happy unison, is replaced by a more intricate and conflictual model. In his analyses of their poetry, poetics, ars poetica, and speculative writings, Brann directly points to the disarraying dilemmas, discrepancies, and contradictions these poets had to live with. Rather than trying to bridge mental gaps, or "plaster cracks," he turns the points of conflict into convenient accesses through which he penetrates the problem of cultural ambiguity. Insightfully he chooses the current medieval topos of the "compunctious poet"-"the poet who exults when young, repents when old, but never ceases to compose" (p. 20)-as both an emblem of and a clue to contemporary poetic problematics. After proving (in chapter 1) that this topos had been deeply ingrained in all medieval cultures, he goes on to establish its specific relevance to the endeavor of the Hebrew Andalusian poets. Brann is interested, using his own words, in the uniquely Jewish significance of the misgivings Hebrew poets express about their verse .... Poetry was, on the one hand, accorded immense prestige, but its legitimacy was also challenged by [society] ... and in the case of Hebrew,</page><page sequence="3">ANDALUSIAN TYPES OF AMBIGUITY 275 by cultural "nationalists." As a typology, then, the compunctious poet can be understood as both an expression of society's ambivalent attitude toward poetry and, for poets who ascribe to the value signified by the typology but do not actually live it, as a sign of their own conflict with contradictory literary, social, and religious commitments. ... In other words, the typology ... is ... evidence of the cultural ambiguity confronted by the poets as they struggled to overcome the guilt it engendered. (p. 22) In the four chapters that follow, Brann vigorously applies his thesis to the works, poetic as well as speculative, of the major Andalusian poets. In chapter 2 he surveys the first generations of the Hebrew poetic school, putting a special emphasis on the incorporation of foreign Arabic prosody and thematics into the native Hebrew biblical language. The opponents of Arabic meters discredited their use in the name of nationalistic arguments-however, they expressed their objections in poems written in these very meters. (And so did Judah ha-Levi, two centuries later, in a prosodical guidebook he composed; while teaching the use of meters via his own poetic illustrations, he added denouncing remarks against the corruption of Hebrew by foreign meters (pp. 101-106.) These practices should be seen, according to Brann, as "literary discourse designed to mediate cultural ambiguity" (p. 24). "As a consequence of such misgivings, poets devised creative strategies for portraying themselves as a 'conservative vanguard,' heirs to the literary traditions of biblical Israel" (p. 37). Poets whose surname happened to be ha-Levi (Samuel ha-Levi ibn Nagrella, Judah ha-Levi, Todros ha-Levi Abulafia) presented themselves as followers of the musical practice of the Levites. In Ha-Kuzari, Judah ha-Levi even suggested that the chants of the Levites should serve as an ultimate model for Hebrew poetry. In his war poems, where he extensively adopted Arabic viewpoints and thematics, ha-Nagid (ibn Nagrella) constantly used biblical "typologies of historical recurrence" (pp. 47-54), whereby he identified himself with ancient Hebrew warriors, in hope for God's salvation. Contrariwise, in his wine and love poems ha-Nagid "secularizes" biblical allusions for the sake of wit and humor (pp. 41-46). A central case in Brann's discussion is Moses ibn Ezra, the only poet to compose a detailed poetics of Hebrew poetry (written, of course, in the Arabic language). His is an apologetic poetics, trying to prove that the poetic, figurative, and rhetorical tenets of Arabic are not foreign to Hebrew, and are, in fact, rooted in biblical poetry. "[He] had taken upon himself the</page><page sequence="4">276 TOVA ROSEN daunting burden of serving two opposing authoritative literary traditions and cultures-Arabic poetry and secular culture on the one hand, and the Hebrew Bible and Jewish tradition on the other" (p. 83). Unlike ibn Ezra, "his most illustrious protege, Judah ha-Levi ... found himself at cross-purposes with his art" (ibid.), questioning the learning, the manners, and the poetry of his country and society. Ha-Levi is said to have gone through an all-encompassing mystical "conversion"-overtly expressed in his Ha-Kuzari as well as in his poetry; and personally executed in his penitent pilgrimage to the Promised Land. He is, for Brann, the actual embodiment of the compunctious poet. Yet, despite his view that Hebrew is a divine, ontologically superior, metalanguage, which should not be defiled by acculturated foreign habits, and despite his direct attacks on the arabization of Hebrew poetry, ha-Levi never ceased to employ Arabic prosody and style, in his secular, as well as in his religious verse (chap. 4). This typology of cultural ambiguity continues in Christian Spain from the thirteenth century onwards (chap. 5). Renewed attacks on the legitimacy of poetry by the new pietistic Jewish circles demanded new poetical defensive tactics-and a fresh treatment of the old typology. This is illustrated in the didactic-philosophical work of Shem-Tov ibn Falaqera and in poets like Meshulam da-Pierra and Todros Abulafia. In the two latter writers, the topos of the 'compunctious poet' undergoes an ironic transformation and turns into the 'deceiving poet'. Admitting their fault, the poets paradoxically (as in the famous "paradox of the liar") defended the right of art to be fictional and yet no less legitimate. In a postscript, Brann shows how this typology was handed over to Hebrew Italian Renaissance and Baroque poets. While consistently tracing his scarlet thread-the theme of cultural ambi- guity-through the ages, Brann also succeeds, with great talent and erudition, in unfolding a wide historical perspective of the Andalusian school. This includes extensive information about Spanish Jewry, the lives of the poets, and general remarks on their respective works, themes, and styles. Brann's book is a scholarly work par excellence, well documented with a host of accompanying notes, covering a huge corpus of bibliography. However, I cannot refrain from noting the lack of a bibliography and indices. This is quite lamentable in a scholarly work of this excellent order. Brann's original insights, together with his meticulous argumentation, constitute an important contribution to the field. Moreover, the model suggested here for the treatment of cultural ambiguity in Hebrew literature can lend itself to the treatment of</page><page sequence="5">ANDALUSIAN TYPES OF AMBIGUITY 277 other ambivalent or ambiguous cultures. Since it manages to combine the specific with the general, in a style which is both eloquent and fluent, it is a book which can be easily followed and heartily enjoyed by the general reader as well as by the professional.
