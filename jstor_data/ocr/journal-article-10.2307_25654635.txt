Association for Jewish Studies, 2009 doi: 10.1017/S0364009409990018 The Introduction to Divre bin ah by Dov Ber of Bolechow: An Unexamined Source for the History of Jews in the Lwow Region in the Second Half of the Eighteenth Century by Gershon David Hundert* Surprisingly, historians have not yet carefully examined the introductory pages of the unpublished manuscript Divre binah (Understanding Words) by Dov Ber Birkenthal.1 Although the evidence of a single witness seldom leads to the revision of historical narratives, the material provided in these introductory pages is quite rich and suggests much about a number of topics that will be of particular interest to students of the eighteenth century. Among these themes are Jewish attitudes to Christianity, to the new Austrian regime in Galicia, to the Enlightenment, and to early Hasidism. The author, an elderly successful business man, wrote the work in question after retiring to his hometown, Bolechow. His book affords us a glimpse into his way of understanding his society and his time. Dov Ber ben Yehuda Birkenthal (or Brezer, 1723-1805) wrote another book as well. Mark Wischnitzer published some substantial fragments, which are all that survive, of Dov Ber's Memoirs in 1922.2 Dov Ber's second book, Divre binah, *I wrote this article during my tenure (2007-2008) as a fellow of the Institute for Advanced Studies at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. The institute provided ideal conditions for scholarly work. A number of my colleagues there and elsewhere provided advice and suggestions that were indis pensable in the preparation of this study.

Jerusalem, Jewish National Library, MS B964: Divre binah, pp. 329, completed 1800. The author explains that the numerical value of the letters in the title of his book (im ha-kolel) is the same as the numerical value of the letters in his name (284). There seems to be a page missing between pp. 174 and 175. 2.

Apparently through the offices of Ber's son-in-law, Dr. Yakovka (Jacob) Rapoport (1775-1855), the manuscript was placed in Yosef Perl's library in Tarnopol in 1814. From there, it arrived in Jerusalem after World War I, and today the autograph copy of the 329-page book is held by the Manuscript Division of the Jewish National Library.4 Dov Ber notes on the cover page of Divre binah that he completed the book in 1800. This date is presented on the title page as the numerical value of la-yeshua ule-nehamah (for redemption and consolation). It is apparent, thus, that the first scholar to analyze the manuscript miscalculated the date as 1780; a number of passages in the text support the veracity of the later date.5 For example, there are references to a Hungarian law of 1791 and to the tax on Sabbath candles imposed in 1797. Nonetheless, Joseph II (d. February 1790) is referred to as if he were still alive,6 which suggests that Dov Ber was working from a diary or from notes he Memoirs, see Roman Marcinkowski, "Dow Ber z Bolechowa: 'uzupelniac tore wiedza swiatowa,"' in Zydzi ijudaizm we wspolczesnych badaniach polskich, ed.

Brawer, "A Posthumous Change of Name (Birkenthal not Bole chower)," Jewish Quarterly Review, new series, 13 (1922): 99-100. A systematic comparison of Divre binah and the Memoirs is certainly a desideratum. The purpose of the present article, however, is to present only the introduction to Divre binah. 3. Shmu'el Werses, "Ginze Yosef Perl bi-yrushalayim ve-gilgulehem," Ha-Universitah 19 (1974): 40-45 (38-52). Werses describes the impassioned but only partially successful attempts of Avraham Yaakov Brawer, Bialik, Agnon, Dov Sadan, and others to rescue the treasures of the Perl collection. The key figure in this effort was a Tarnopol native who worked at the Jewish National Library, Simhah Katz (1904-40). See also Werses, "Shivim shenot heker yetsirato u-foalo shel Yosef Perl," Huliyot 1 (2002): 327 (321-38). 4. The Perl materials were inaccessible after the War of Independence until they were brought from Mount Scopus in 1958. During the 1980s, the manuscript of Divre binah was misplaced and remained lost until some five years ago, when it was found, misfiled under Djerba (!), and microfilmed. Although I worked with the microfilm, the acting director of the Institute of Microfilmed Hebrew Manuscripts, Dr. Yael Okun, kindly permitted me to examine the original manuscript as well to verify my readings. 5.

There is another dating problem that is beyond the scope of the present study. On pp. 54-75, the author quotes in Hebrew from She 'erit Yisra 'el by Menahem Amelander, citing chapter 26, p. 69. Published originally in Yiddish, the first known published Hebrew version of that book appeared in Lwow in 1804. Moreover, in that Hebrew version, the chapter that Ber quotes is numbered chapter 24, and the wording is quite different. Thus, either Dov Ber used a different translation, unknown to us, or he translated the passages himself. In either case, the passages should be of interest to students of the history of Yiddish. 226</page><page sequence="3">The Introduction to Divre binah by Dov Ber of Bolechow had prepared over the years. Most probably, the final composition of Divre binah followed the writing of the memoirs. Dov Ber intended to publish Divre binah, but the rabbi of Lwow, Zevi Hirsh Rozanes, refused to grant him an approbation because of the text's many negative remarks about Christianity; Rozanes advised Dov Ber to correct these. Avraham Yaakov Brawer reports this exchange on the basis of correspondence between Dov Ber and Yakovka Rapoport. The letters, however, have not been preserved.7 Dov Ber Birkenthal was born in Bolechow in 1723 and died and was buried there in 1805. His mother, Esther, died on his fifteenth birthday. In a passage virtually unique in his writings for its display of emotion?note the repetition of his mother's name?the author tells us in his Memoirs: [0]n the sixth of the month of Second Adar, which fell on a Sabbath, my mother, the virtuous and pious marat Esther, daughter of the distinguished R. Mordecai, died at nine o'clock in the evening. She died in the fifty-fourth year of her life after having been greatly afflicted for more than a year with dropsy of the leg. She died peacefully [metah be-neshikah] and without struggle. At the same hour and day, on the same date of the month of Adar, my mother Esther had brought me into the world with great pains of child birth, as I narrated on page ... [there is no such page preserved]. She almost died in giving birth to me; but out of the compassion of Heaven on me, the weak and newly born, there were added to her life, out of Divine favor, fourteen more years, so that she could raise me to obey the Torah, the commandments, and to bind phylacteries.8 Dov Ber married twice, the first time at age sixteen in 1739. This marriage was forced on him, "because of our many sins," by "the wife of my father, my stepmother, Feige."9 The young woman "was not suited to me [she-'eno [sic] hagunah //]." They were together for two and a half years; "she had no issue and I was freed of her by the grace of God, may He be blessed." Dov Ber sub sequently married Leah, who was, he says, his predestined partner.10 Later, he refers to her as exemplary, saying that her upstanding qualities were well known to all, both Jews and Gentiles (le-havdil).u He also describes a premoni tory and foreboding dream before a disastrous attack on Bolechow by bandits. 7. Brawer, Galiziyah, 208. In the summer of 1802, Ber had sent the manuscript of his book, in fifteen notebooks, to Hayyim Kurmash, the former shtadlan of Lwow, asking that he review its contents and consult with others to ensure its accuracy. Hayyim's response to this request, which affirms Ber's accuracy, makes it clear that he expected the book would be published; see N. M. Gelber, "Shalosh teudot le-toledot ha-tenuah ha-Frankit be-Polin," lion 2 (1937): 330 (326-32). 8. Memoirs, 72; Zikhronot, 41. 9. The Memoirs include references, in addition to his stepmother, to two other women whom Dov Ber blames for different unhappy developments?the wife of his partner, and his sister-in-law. Both women are portrayed as responsible for coming between Ber and his fellow. The motif of "the quarrelsome woman" in early modern Jewish literature awaits its researcher. 10.

Yehuda's success was attributable, in part, to his knowledge of Polish and Hungarian. Dov Ber himself spent much of his life and conducted business in Lwow, where commercial activities brought him into contact with Polish merchants, nobles, Catholic priests and monks, and businessmen from numerous European states. He learned a number of languages, including Polish, Latin, French, and German. In his Memoirs, Dov Ber explains his acquisition of Polish as follows: I also learned the Polish language to please my father, who wanted me to know it. He kept a tutor in his house, an educated Polish gentleman, who made me conversant with Polish speech and writing. I learned it perfectly in a very short time. Moreover, I studied Latin and understood the principal part of its grammar.13 Not hesitant to record what reflected on him well, Dov Ber also quotes a certain Jacob, who says of him, I know a man who is a Jew and who writes Polish as nobody else can. All the nobles are astonished that he writes so well, and praise him for his fluency in the Polish language.... He is the young R. Ber, the brother of the well-known kazin R. Aryeh Loeb of Bolechow.14 In Divre binah, as will be seen, Dov Ber offers a different explanation for having learned Polish and other languages. In the memoirs, he also mentions a Jewish woman, named Khule, who not only spoke Polish but also knew how to receive a nobleman properly (ke-derekh ha-prizim) in her home and to offer him appropri ate wine.15 We learn of a Jew in Krakow in the mid-eighteenth century who knew a number of languages, including Latin.16 Even more noteworthy, the scholar and 12.

Ber sought to deceive a nobleman and persuade him that he was a resident of Lwow. The nobleman, Ber tells us, asked to meet Ber's wife. So Ber "promptly" sent his Hungarian Jewish assistant to his neighbor's wife?Khule?to ask her to go to Ber's house and "to entertain him in the Polish language after the fashion of the nobles [ke-derekh ha-perizim] and to make him believe that she was my wife. She came to my house, received him as hostess, and ordered a bottle of good wine, which he drank; and he believed her to be my wife." 16.

Divre binah contains a history of messianic movements and particularly concentrates on the Sabbatian-Frankist episode, focusing on the author's promi nent role, because of his knowledge of Polish, in the debate between the Frankists and the rabbis in Lwow in 1759.18 Dov Ber's discussion of messianism and its history begins on page 49 and continues to the end of the book. Much space is devoted to quotations from Mdaseh Tuvyah, She'erit Yisra'el, Kizur tsitsat novel Zevi, and Mishnat hakhamim.19 Avraham Yaakov Brawer (1884-1975), who saw the manuscript of Divre binah in Tarnopol, published some forty pages of the text in installments in Ha-Shiloah between 1917 and 1921.20 Brawer's quotations from the book are drawn almost exclusively from the Frankist episode, and he provides a much too brief summary of the introductory pages of the manuscript. Brawer was con vinced that he had copied the only valuable and "original" parts of the book. In fact, he explains in his own memoirs that he blocked publication of the parts of Divre binah that he had not copied.21 Hence, I have chosen to describe and begin to analyze the introductory section?the first forty-eight pages of the book. Dov Ber on Christianity On page 2 of the text, which amounts to a second title page, the author announces his purpose, which is "to cause lying words against our religion to 17.

"There appeared in Jerusalem a young scholar who had also been to the Perl Library, found the manuscript [of Divre binah] and copied what I had omitted. He wanted to publish these portions. Professor Simhah Assaf asked my opinion and I answered that what I omitted was copied by Dov Ber from Hebrew and Polish books. The Hebrew books were checked?the Polish ones were unavailable in the land [of Israel] then?and it was found that my words were correct.

And, indeed, one of his concerns, which finds expression in the early pages, is the defense of Judaism in general and of the Oral Torah in particular in the face of polemical remarks by Christians. Dov Ber tells us that he spent most of his life in Lwow engaged in the wine business, in the course of which he had fre quent contact with, and often entered the homes of, Christian laymen and priests. He notes that "virtually daily" they would demean Judaism, saying that Jews had lost their ancient wisdom: "You are all confused and nothing remains to you but your Talmud which misleads and betrays you; it is full of absurdities and many lies."22 Dov Ber's desire to find a way to answer the enemies of Judaism began in his youth. His father, in addition to owning a wine business, operated an inn that attracted people of various nations. "And often the first thing they said was against the Oral Torah." It was from that time that Dov Ber, he says, resolved to study their languages assiduously in order to be able to read their books. And, indeed, he used his free time for this purpose. Still, as a young person, he was afraid to read the writings of Gentiles because "they [the writings] are much detested among our people." He was afraid, he says, until he found Lehem Yehuda by the Sephardic scholar Yehuda Yuda ben Shemu'el Lerma, which is a commentary on the Ethics of the Fathers.23 In his Memoirs, as noted, Dov Ber explains that he learned Polish at the behest of his father. He had to stop, he explains there, because "some of the people in our community began to gossip about me and to suspect my faith ... and I had to give up my [secular] studies."24 The treatment of this matter in Divre binah, however, suggests that he did not cease his reading in European languages. To further justify and support his path, Dov Ber also presents, in addition to the passage from Lehem Yehuda, the comments of Yitshak Arama, Maimonides, and Abravanel on a well-known passage in Ethics of the Fathers (2:14-15): Rabbi Elazar [ben Arakh] said: Be eager to study the Torah. Know what to respond to a heretic. Know before Whom you toil and Who is your Employer Who shall pay you the reward of your labor. 22. Divre binah, 3.

Memoirs, 80; Zikhronot, 46. 230</page><page sequence="7">The Introduction to Divre binah by Dov Ber of Bolechow Dov Ber summarizes the commentators' views as follows: The intention of the rabbi's warning is not to demand that a person devote himself exclusively to the study of the Torah. In order to know how to respond to heretics, one must know their books and the source of their error. "And how much more so in our generation ... when our Faith is much desecrated among the gentiles, certainly there is no fault if we know how to respond to their questions in their language. Once God had revealed this to me, I determined to take up this simple task; perhaps God's name will be sanctified by me in this way."25 The Sephardic com mentators to Ethics of the Fathers thus provide Ber with a legitimate rationale for his study of "their books."26 Although, in this passage, the author presents himself as convinced of the appropriateness of his study of languages, other passages in other contexts in Divre binah suggest a more conventional, isolationist tendency. As will be seen later, he praises Polish Jews for not using a single word of Russian or Polish.27 And in a passage that Dov Ber quotes from Mishnat hakhamim, the author, Moshe Hagiz, recounts the story of the martyrdom of Hayyim Reizes in Lwow. According to Hagiz, Reizes attested that he was going to be executed in such a cruel fashion?having his tongue torn out?because he had learned Latin and other languages.28 Dov Ber's keen desire to find ways to answer the accusations of Christians, however, is unquestionable. There follows a brief recounting of the tradition regarding the transmission of the Oral Torah and a statement of its utter reliability. Indeed, this subject is a leitmotif of the first forty-nine pages of Divre binah.29 The reliability of the chain of transmission of the Torah seems intended to be persuasive evidence of its authority, in contrast to what Dov Ber characterizes as the irrational and forged traditions of other monotheistic faiths. Moreover, the first debate with the Frankists, which takes up much space in the latter pages of Divre binah not considered in the present article, focused on the Talmud and the accusation that it was blasphemous.30 Dov Ber then characterizes Christianity and Islam in a way that is distin guished by its relatively neutral tone. He presents the early Christians as rebels against the rabbis, stating that the first Christians persisted in their ways until "they were driven out and separated themselves" from the community of Israel. 25. Divre binah, 6-8. 26. Cf. "We Jews must know all things, so that there may be realized in us the saying from the Bible: 'For this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations' [Deuteronomy 4:6]. Although our teachers, be their memories for a blessing, applied this saying to our holy Torah, they also taught that it is good to combine Torah with worldly knowledge; and it is advantageous for every intel ligent and educated Jew to have a knowledge of the history of the nations of the world. This will some times enable him properly to answer questions directed against the Jewish Law and faith, as has occurred to me several times in my discourses with the nobles and the clergy. In most of the cases I have found the right answer, and it is well-known to all that my replies were always convincing" {Memoirs, 141-42; Zikhronot, 87). 27. Divre binah, 18-19. 28. Ibid., 40. 29.

These Christians took hold only of the Written Torah, the Prophets, and the Writ ings, and imprisoned them without understanding their meaning." Indeed, they mis interpreted verses to signify their Redeemer and to strengthen their own religion.31 Somewhat later in the introductory pages, Dov Ber discusses the matter of the sacred texts of Christianity and Islam. He characterizes them as scriptural reli gions (toraniyim), a term, I believe, previously not used in this sense in writings by rabbinic Jews, at least in Eastern Europe. It is true, on the other hand, that Yaakov Emden uses similar terminology, and that Moshe Hagiz, whom Ber quotes exten sively,32 seems to take a similar stance.33 Dov Ber says, The Christians have a version of the Torah of Moses and the Prophets in their Bible [bibli'ah]; however, it is not edited but forged from its beginning to its end because they received it from various nations in many languages through their forging priests over a long period of time, almost two thousand years. Each nation in turn added distortions and forgeries until it was completely counterfeit.... So, too, the Ishmaelites of the Mohammedan religion, although there is in their Koran something of the Torah of Moses, it too is forged and mixed with the lies of Mohammed their false prophet.34 On the subject of the Christian Bible {sifre evan gelyon),35 Dov Ber asserts that its books support the Torah of Moses. He notes that the Christian Bible testifies that Jesus came to fulfill the Torah and not to annul it, "as is explained in several places in their books, Matthew chapter 5, verse 17."36 He asserts that he presented this issue to the priest (Gaudenty) Pikulski, "the author of the book Jewish Malice, in Polish Zlosc zydowski, and he responds to my question in that book on page 435."37 The reference is correct; in the second edition of his book, Pikulski 31.

Pikulski's formulation of Ber's question is, "Let us grant that Christ was the true Messiah and thus all the prophecies were fulfilled in him. He says, however, in Matthew 5:17, T have not come to destroy the Law [of Moses] but to fulfill it.' Why do you Catholics not fulfill the Law of Moses? You do not keep the Sabbath but Sunday. Either your Christ said these words with a false heart, or you obey neither God nor Christ."38 According to Ber, Pikulski's response was foolish, as "there is no answer to my question."39 Ber's various objections to Christian teaching, and his knowledge of the New Testament, derive in part from Yizhak ben Avraham of Troki's Hizuk emunah, especially "the second part of this book [which includes] translations to the Holy Tongue of many passages in the Evan gelyon and the books of the messengers of Jesus; these are the apostles."40 He praises this author, of whose Karaite identity he seems unaware, saying that no Jewish opponent of Christianity has ever been his equal in attacking the very foundations of their foolish faith. Still, he notes the usefulness in this regard also of Yom Tov Lipman Mulhausen's Sefer nizahon,41 and of Mdaseh Tuvyah. Despite the efforts of these scholars, many could not tolerate the contempt and scorn of the exile at the hands of these "sons of Ham, Put, and Canaan,"42 idol worshippers who daily defame Jews before the rulers "of the states and lands of Europe both in spoken words and in books printed more and more often in order to arouse their hatred against us."43 Among the lies propagated against Jews was the blood libel. Not surpris ingly, Ber goes on at some length about this topic, as the issue had been a central theme at the Lwow confrontation with the Frankists in 1759, to which he alludes briefly. He notes that the libel had been transmitted among priests for centuries, and cites their words: The Jews cannot eat the unleavened bread on Passover without the blood of Christians. For this purpose they kidnap their sons and slaughter them to obtain their blood to eat it with the unleavened bread on the first night of Pass over. The reason they give for this is the notion, both stupid and very strange, that the unjustified spilling of the blood of the Christian boy would atone on 38.

This happened "not only in faraway lands, but also in several nearby communities." Ber says that he feels obliged to recount this suffering, "so that those who come after us will not say that the early days were better than today."45 Ber asserts that, in particular, the people and rulers of Poland, "together with their priests," believed the libels. He notes that he has found evidence of this in historical works in Polish, which he has translated into Hebrew.46 Such material is indeed presented in the latter part of the book in connection with the Frankist debate. The wise responses of Rabbi Hayyim (ben Simhah ha-Kohen) Rapoport47 during the Lwow debate in 1759 put this accusation to rest; moreover, Ber states that new trends of thought are now found among scholars of Europe: Great, wise, and learned scholars have arisen lately among the gentiles. They are familiar with many ancient books, and have written much, as a result of their researches, against idol worshippers and, even more, against Christians. They utterly deny the stories of their [the early Christians'] deeds, saying the tales of miracles in their New Testament [toratam ha-hadashah] ... are unbe lievable and contrary to Nature.48 Dov Ber's attitude to Christianity thus includes a measure of respect, but it is, ulti mately, somewhat contemptuous. He predicts that Christianity and Christians will disappear and be forgotten, just as idolatry and idolaters have disappeared from human memory 49 Dov Ber on the new Austrian regime In Dov Ber's account, the origins of Jewish settlement in Poland began with the arrival of Jews from Ashkenaz. At the time, Poland was a neglected wilderness that lacked precious goods, gold, and silver, so the Jews brought their many treas ures in an arrangement with the dukes and leaders of Krakow. He says that Poland had no king then, but was ruled by twelve provincial governors. It was they who accepted the Jews, receiving a huge loan from them and granting them the right of settlement on the condition that they continue to dress in their customary way. Indeed, Jews not only did not imitate the dress of their neighbors, but also did 44. Ibid. 45. Ibid., 12-13. 46. Ibid., 14. 47.

"To speak amongst themselves, they used Yiddish [leshon Ashkenazi] without a single word from the 'Russian' [perhaps Ruthenian is meant] or Polish languages." The Polish authorities also permitted Jews to build magnificent and important buildings for their synagogues.50 The First Partition of Poland in 1772 brought much of Galicia, as it was then called, under the sway of Austrian rulers. The author presents contradictory opinions about the new Habsburg regime and its laws affecting Jews. He alludes, for example, to legislation that is not recorded in standard texts on Jews in the Habsburg lands: And now under the rule of our Lord the magnificent pious Joseph II, His majesty the Emperor, whose honor is revealed in all the states of his kingdom [it has been decreed] that all the blood libels against the Jews are false and untrue. No ruler or judge may put faith in such [an accusation] against the Jews on pain of huge fines.51 Although such Habsburg legislation is unknown, a ruling to this effect was, in fact, issued by the Hungarian authorities in 1791: The Jewish community living in this kingdom turned to this Royal Hungarian Lieutenancy Council with the bitter complaint that in most Christians the preju dice according to which Jews need Christian blood to celebrate the holiday of Passover has risen again. Consequently, Jews are severely persecuted, especially by common people. Several instances are mentioned to prove it. Since these views and the like interfere with the peace and security of the Jewish people, the Royal Hungarian Lieutenancy Council deems it necessary to decree that the prejudice of Christian blood sacrifice at Jewish services be erased from the mind of the people with the assistance of priests. The Jewish religion is based on the laws of Moses and the prophetic books, that is, on the Old Testa ment; therefore, it is not at all worse than the laws of other religions. As a result, if a Jew commits murder, it is not because of their religion. You should not blame the whole Jewish people more than Christians in a similar case. Finally, the Royal Hungarian Lieutenancy Council decrees that those who persecute or abuse Jews are to be punished severely.52 50. Ibid., 18-19; cf. Brawer, Galiziyah, 203. 51. Ibid., 16. 52.

He notes, among others, the legislation of 1785 limiting rabbinic courts to matters exclusively related to religion and to functioning as a court of arbitration in other spheres: According to the government, may God preserve it, rabbinic courts may not subpoena Jews, although it is explained in the imperial code [ba-sistem meha k'yr'h] that our rabbis are permitted to function as an arbitration court [la-arokh mishpatim lifnehem be-torat kompromost].54 In Bolechow, Ber explains, the community found a way around this law by having all its members sign and seal the writ of appointment of the rabbi,55 including accepting his right to subpoena them in any matter without appeal to government und selbe zu belehren, dass dieses verachtungswurdige Laster dem Monarchic Gesetz und den Schriften der Propheten, mithin der ganzen Vorschrift des alten Testaments auf welche sich doch die Jiidische Religion vorziiglich griindet nicht minder als den Gesetzen der ubrigen Religionen zuwider sey. Daher konne auch die von dem ein oder andern Juden veriibte Mordthat, wenn sichs auch befinden wurde, dass solche aus aberglaubischen Absichten geschehen, der ganzen Judischen Nazion nicht mit mehr Recht zur Last gelegt werden, als man dergleichen Falle wegen, wenn sie sich unter den Chris ten ereigneten, auf alle einen Hafi werfet.

The end of Jewish communal autonomy was legislated in the Judensystem in Galizien (note that Dov Ber uses the term system) promulgated in May 1785 by Joseph II. Cf Josef Karniel, "Das Toleranzpatent Kaiser Josephs II. Fiir die Juden Galiziens un Lodomeriens," Jahrbuch des Instituts fur Deutsche Geschichte 11 (1982), 59, 72-74 (55-89). The notion of courts of arbitration chaired by communal rabbis is anticipated in the Allgemeine Ordnungfur die gesamte Judenschaft der konigreiche Galizien und Lodomerien promulgated by Maria Theresa in July, 1776, 5:3, which is headed "Von den judischen compromissen."

Rachel Manekin notes in an unpublished study that in the discussions between govern ment officials and leading Jews in 1784, the officials emphasized that despite the anticipated disestabl ishment of Jewish communal courts, the option of arbitration courts would remain available: "wobei es sich jedoch von selbsten verstehet, dass den Parteien immer frei stehet, mit Vorbeigehung des Judicis ordinarii, sich auf ein Compromiss ensulassen." 55.

It is now, he says, two years since the rabbi assumed his post, and not a single community member has resorted to the courts (of the Gentiles).56 Dov Ber mentions, with regret, the decrees of 1789 forbidding Jews to hold arendas in the villages: For several years now the poor Jews have been deprived and forbidden arendas in the villages, from leasing the mills, the tolls, and from other good monopolies [maarufiyot ha-tovim].57 He is unhappier still with the Candle Tax of 1797 and its consequences because the legislation resulted not only in the abolition of the capitation tax but also in the end of government recognition of the kahal. In response, he states, "Our people is left like sheep without a shepherd."58 Moreover, the Habsburg system had led to the corruption of the rabbinic office. Dov Ber's response to the situation created by the Habsburg legislation forms part of his more general set of opinions about community leadership. This section of his text begins after his rejection of Kabbalah and his description of the "proper" qualities of the traditional rabbi?namely, that a rabbi ought to be fully occupied with the study of the revealed Torah, Talmud, and halakhah. In this way, rabbis become equipped to respond to questions and can publish them in the form of responsa literature. The study of ethical literature is also deemed impor tant. And those who preach and rebuke the people also ought to be salaried by the communities, as is the case with the rabbis.59 Dov Ber also insists that rabbis must be appointed by the Jews themselves and paid from communal funds so that they can act as impartial judges. He hopes that all communities will find a way to follow the example of the town of Bole chow. Doing so will help Jews resist abrogation of the halakhah and will also fulfill the commandment that states, "You shall appoint for yourself judges" (Deu teronomy 16:18). The words "for yourself," he claims, mean by yourselves and not by the government. Up to this time, rabbinical appointments had been based on large gifts of cash to government officials. That situation occurred despite the will of the majority of the community, and often resulted in the appointment of unfit persons.60 Ber also quotes a lengthy passage from Mishnat hakhamim, devoted mainly to condemning the long-standing ("several hundred years") prac tice in Poland of the purchase of rabbinical offices.61 56.

He prays that Jews living under the emperor will find a way to return to the practice of annually electing "seven good men" by majority vote.62 These men would be empowered to evaluate wealth and assess taxes for communal needs, and would also take counsel together to decide on appropriate "gifts" for government officials. Finally, Dov Ber hopes that the leaders of individual communities will be permitted to form a council of all com munities. This would, however, be contrary to the recently promulgated law for bidding just such an institution, and forbidding the expenditure of communal funds to send representatives to Vienna or even to Lwow.63 The importance to Ber of the Council of Four Lands, disestablished by the Polish government in 1764, is made clear in his Memoirs', he states that, while it existed, the council rep resented "a small redemption and a bit of honor" for Jews. He then asserts that the Confederation of Bar, which culminated in the partition of Poland in 1772, was divine retribution for the abolition of the council.64 Dov Ber on the Enlightenment To Dov Ber, the times had brought changes other than those the Habsburg regime imposed on its Jewish population: An even worse evil has developed. In these times, some of our people have begun to imitate the unshaven young men of Ashkenaz65 who are accustomed from their youth to pursue the appetites of this world, and they permit them selves [to transgress] several positive and negative commandments, for many have mingled with gentiles. They learned wastefulness from them and to deny everything. Because of our many sins, these are heretics worse than the Sad ducees and Boethusians of the days of the Second Temple .... Therefore, I deemed it appropriate to write some [words] about the knowledge of God that I have collected from the holy books of investigation of the wise men among the Sephardim.66 There follow some six pages under the subheading "Knowledge of God, May He Be Blessed." Ber delves into the inability of the human mind to grasp divinity, and strongly affirms the existence of individual providence (hashgahah peratit). We must first study our own souls, he says, before we seek to understand our Creator. This is the teaching of the philosophers (de'u nafshekhem ve-tedu eloke khem). Indeed, a human being is a microcosm of the universe, and the divine 62. The phrase is talmudic (e.g., B. Megillah 26a) and stands for the elected leadership of the community. 63. Divre binah, 38-39. 64. Memoirs, 150; Zikhronot, 92. 65. One wonders whether this passage refers to teachers brought to Galicia by (Naftali) Herz Homberg (1749-1841), and especially to the Pedagogical Seminary he established in Lwow in 1792. 66. Ibid., 42. Cf. Brawer, Galiziyah, 204. 238</page><page sequence="15">The Introduction to Divre binah by Dov Ber of Bolechow element is the soul. The Lord is the soul of the world and of nature?and the numerical values of nature (teva) and the Lord (Elohim) are equivalent (86). Ber then adamantly denies the view of some heretics who claim that the world functions according to its own nature without divine providence.67 Dov Ber on early Hasidism Dov Ber devotes considerable space to the phenomenon of Hasidism, and constructs what can be read as an accounting for the appearance of its growth on the basis of four ingredients: region, changes in the method of study of Talmud, the growing preoccupation with the esoteric (razin de-oraita), and the influence of bdalei shemot (masters of the Name; akin to shamans).68 Dov Ber associates the beginnings of Hasidism with "Podolia and Ukraine," a region he characterizes as having been settled originally mainly by the poor who could not find gainful work in older communities. It was in that region also that Cossacks, in each generation, rebelled and murdered many Jews. Dov Ber says that ancient customs are neglected in that area; as examples, he notes the absence of the wearing of a special head covering (braytl) and jacket (letnik) for prayer in the synagogue: "They do not prepare such garments for prayer in the holy synagogue but pray and study in whatever clothing they wear every day to the market."69 "Worse than this," he asserts, "the scholars of our generation have ceased to study the Talmud be-pilpula harifta, as was the ancient custom."70 The abandonment of the traditional ways of studying was precipitated, as Dov Ber presents it, by a spreading preoccupation with the esoteric. He captures this trend 67. Divre binah, 43-44. Cf. Mdaseh Tuvyah, 1: attacks those Jews who believe that everything happens according to ha-teva u-minhago?natural law?without divine intervention in the world. 68. In the Memoirs, there is virtually no attention to Hasidism. Ber does mention a man?sub sequently shown to be a fool?who began to behave in the ways of hasidut. This, however, seems not to refer to Beshtian Hasidism (Memoirs, 115; Zikhronot, 69). And there is reference to Ber's contacts with the father and uncle of Yitshak Eisik of (Nagy) Kallo (1751-1821), then a child, and subsequently the Kaliver Rebbe, well known for his songs and most famously "Szol a kakas mar." Dov Ber says of him, "When he grew up his singing made him famous among the Hasidim, as it is 'said 'Sing unto the Lord a new song and His praise in the congregation of the saints [hassidim].\.. R. Eisik became famous throughout the county on account of his piety [hassiduto]. He was diligent in the study of rabbinical authors and became a rabbi and teacher in Israel; to this day he is chief of the bet din in Nagy Kallo" (Memoirs, 130; Zikhronot, 79). On bdalei shem, see Hundert, Jews in Poland-Lithuania, 142-53. 69. Divre binah, 19-20. 70. Ibid., 21. Here Ber offers a brief portrait of yeshiva study: "I myself, as a young man, saw this with my own eyes... At the beginning of the term I studied a page of gemara selected by the rabbi, chief judge and mara de-atra, with all of its commentaries. Each student tried, in accordance with his own ability, to innovate something on the basis of the text and the commentators. First the rabbi himself stood and explicated his own innovative perspective on the passage with his great expertise and enor mous insight. After him all of the advanced students (lomdim) and the students (talmidim) presented their novel insights in accordance with their abilities (kefi hasagato be-pilpulo). The wealthy would invite the advanced students to their homes and entertain them with delicacies and whiskey." Cf. Elcha nan Reiner, "Yeshiva," YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe (New Haven, CT: Yale Univer sity Press, 2008), 2:2051-55. 239</page><page sequence="16">Gershon David Hundert in his report of events that occurred in 1742 when the kabbalistic work Hemdat yamim arrived in Tysmienica, where Dov Ber lived at the time: They purchased the books [Hemdat yamim] for the bet ha-midrash of the holy community of Tysmienica for three adumim [a high price]. Since the author advocates the study of the books of Kabbalah devoted to the secrets of the divine, the students despaired of studying the Talmud and its commentaries be-pilpula harifta.11 The enthusiasm of the young men for this new trend became manifest in the synagogue: I saw with my own eyes several of our people who were possessed by the spirit, and they said it was the spirit of the heretics who had apostatized. They would throw themselves down in the front of the synagogues during the reading of the Torah on the sabbaths and on Mondays and Thursdays. They would pound their chests cruelly with large rocks. No man could suffer, it would seem, the murderous blows I [afflicted on] myself in my youth and in my naivete.72 Although a major part of this passage was published by Brawer, the latter appar ently feared the censor and omitted the reference to the souls of the apostates.73 It is not clear which apostates are meant. One scholar has characterized these pos sessed "madmen" as having the ability to identify the sins of a person, including those committed alone and those committed in a previous incarnation.74 Perhaps the notion that they had been apostates in a previous life is what is meant here. Dov Ber's almost bemused comment about his foolishness as a youth is worthy of note. Solomon Maimon, Dov Ber's considerably younger contemporary (ca. 1753-1800) notes in his autobiography that, as a young man, he became dis illusioned with the rabbis because of their pride and was attracted to people "called hassidim" who devoted their entire lives to strict observance of the command ments, ethics, and morality. Young men seeking alternative ways to serve God seem to have been a phenomenon of the period.75 71. Ibid. 72. Ibid., 22. Cf.

After asserting that what distinguishes the rabbis and scholars and makes them worthy of praise is their vast knowledge of the revealed Torah, Dov Ber cites Deu teronomy 29:28 ("The secret things belong unto the Lord our God; but the things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever"). He then cites a quo tation from the Wisdom of Ben Sirach (Ecclesiasticus 3:21) found in the Talmud (B. Hagiga 13a): "Inquire not into that which is too great for thee; and that which is too hard for thee, search not out. That which is too difficult for thee do not know; and that which is concealed from thee do not ask. Attend to that which is permitted to thee; thou hast no business with hidden things." This is followed by a lengthy (pp. 31-34) quotation from the first chapter of Sefer or ha-hayyim, by Yosef Yavez (Jabez; d. 1507), which "was published first hundreds of years ago and has been issued recently [1791] in Lwow at the order and with the financial support of ... Rabbi Yehuda Leib ben Shne'ur of Bolechow, who is now among the leaders of the community of the capital city of Lwow."76 To lend further support to his argument, Dov Ber quotes from the beginning of the introduction to Ateret zekenim by Yitshak Abravanel, "which was published first in 1557 and a second time in 1739 in Amsterdam."77 After buttressing his position with these passages, the author offers his own explanation for the neglect of traditional Talmud study: It is because, from the time, long ago, when the Zohar was revealed, many of the lazy forsook and abandoned the study of the interpretation of the Torah revealed to us at Sinai_They do not study the Talmud and its commentators ... some among our people who lack the ability to understand the depths of the Talmud ... but wish to be seen as knowledgeable scholars, boast and preen before the people because of their lofty study of the wisdom of Kabbalah and the secrets of the Torah.78 Proper rabbis and leaders, Ber adds, spend their days in the study of halakhah and Talmud. The fourth element in Dov Ber's account of the rise of Hasidism concerns the popular esteem in which bdalei shemot were held. People, he says, would praise them and relate stories about their abilities to heal the sick with amulets and to drive evil spirits out of the possessed by invoking the names of the spirits, each of whose name and function they knew. Indeed, the people were so Zekhariah Mendel of Jaroslaw, "Igeret ha-kodesh," at the end of No'am Elimelekh (New York: Shulzin ger, 1942), 228-30. 76. The book was published in Amsterdam in 1781 as well. The author was a Spanish exile who, in this work, attacks the study of philosophy and those who study it as responsible for the expul sion from Spain. Note that the initiative for republication, and its funding, came from a local scholar. 77. Divre binah, 34. The quotation takes up most of p. 35. 78.

If they thought a house was haunted, they would seek out these bdalei shemot to bring them to drive the demons out through the invocation of holy 79 names. While still in Lwow, Dov Ber met "one of these bdalei shemot"" who con fessed and told him of deceptions he himself had employed to deceive people and those used by others to put the fear of demons in the masses: In 1758 and 1759,1 came to know and to be convinced that we mortals includ ing gentiles have nothing to fear from the influence of demons. Indeed, many ancient scholars had doubts about their existence and some denied it outright, including Maimonides.80 After insisting that one should trust in divine providence rather than be concerned about demons, Dov Ber announces, in what seems to me to be a sardonic, almost Swiftian depiction, that the era of demons has come to an end: It is now some thirty years or more that one has not heard of harm coming to people at the hands of demons.... Mortals have recognized the lies of the bdalei shemot and their deceitful ways. Since the disappearance of the ba'alei shemot with their many books and their vain secrets and enigmas, the harmful demons have not been seen and not the slightest harm ... has been caused to any Jew, great or small, or even to any gentile. For fear of the armies and the numerous soldiers of His Majesty the emperor, the demons have fled entirely from these lands. And the bdalei shemot have changed their name to Hasidim.9,1 For Dov Ber, the hasidim thus arose as a new form of bdalei shemot in the period after "the flight of the demons." It is difficult to know which date he is implying when he states that "some thirty years ago," hasidim appeared. Perhaps he is refer ring to the partition of Poland (and the end of the Bar Confederacy and its accom panying chaotic military battles) in 1772, but he is more likely alluding to the debate with the Frankists in 1759. In any case, Ber has more to say about these newly appeared hasidim, and it may be that the notion proposed in recent historical literature that bdalei shem were "endowed ... with high status in Jewish society," and that "they had the respect of the scholars even though they themselves often were not scholars," will have to be reexamined in light of his comments.82 79.

Because a major subject of Divre binah is messianism, one might think that the devotion of a section of the book to Hasidism implies that the author viewed the movement as messianic. This, however, is not the case, both because the sections in which Hasidism is mentioned precede the author's turning to the subject of messianism and its history, and because the word messiah does not appear in the paragraphs devoted to Hasidism. What he seems to be doing is sketching the background of his time and emphasizing the problem of the new place of Kabbalah in Jewish culture. While Ber says that the hasidim, as mentioned, had been known formerly as ba'alei shemot, he also notes that they are called mekubalim?kabbalists who teach esoteric secrets of the divine to students who are unprepared for such study:83 Their entire purpose is to know the esoteric and their desire is to study divine secrets. These they reveal to themselves when they gather in one of their large houses to study with [their leader] during the third meal on the Sabbath.84 Ber, however, has ascertained in person from his own encounters with hasidic leaders that they know nothing of Kabbalah: More than a few times, I myself asked several of their great ones who were staying in my house to reveal to me some of the divine secrets. None of them responded in a satisfactory way. Since that time, I have come to know absolutely that they know no divine secrets, just a few hints in kab balistic books of the rabbi Yisra'el b"s [bdal shem], z"l [may his memory be a blessing]. And these make no sense [ve- 'en lahem shahar]*5 The reference to "kabbalistic books of the rabbi Yisra'el b"s" (i.e., the Besht, Yisra'el Baal Shem Tov), most likely relates to the books of his school, of his fol lowers. Dov Ber then expresses, with sarcasm, his skepticism that hasidim were 83. "Mi-pi ha-mekubalim hemah ha-hasidim o ba'ale ha-shemot shemi-kedem hayu mityahasim le-kadmonehem shem zeh" (Divre Binah, 22). In his characterization of the Sabbatian ascetics, Dov Ber says, "they called themselves by the name Kabbalists" (ibid., 187). 84. Ibid., 27. 85. There is sufficient evidence that there were hasidim in Lwow to warrant granting trust worthiness to Dov Ber's claim. Meshulam ben Shimshon Igra (1742-1801) of Tysmienica wrote a letter in 1793 at the time of his departure for Pressburg, addressed to the leaders of Brody and Lwow, attacking Hasidism. Yisra'el Loebel, in his German antihasidic tract, published in 1799, reports that two hasidic leaders lived in Lwow in 1798. See Mordecai Wilensky, Hasidim u-mitnaggedim, 2nd ed. (Jerusalem: Mosad Bialik, 1990), 1:178; 2:337, 366. Cf. Entsiklopediyah shel galuyot, Lvov (Tel Aviv, 1956), 4:221, 425. Uriel Gellman kindly brought my attention to the fact that the brother-in-law of the Seer of Lublin was an active hasid in Lwow, and that Uri of Strelisk resided in Lwow for a period of time. He added that there are notes about Hasidism in Lwow before 1800 in Yosef Te'omim, Or Torah (Jerusalem, 1999). 243</page><page sequence="20">Gershon David Hundert qualified to pronounce the kavanot (intentional formulae before prayer) of the kabbalist Isaac Luria with the proper intention.86 Dov Ber claims that the hasidim study neither Aggadah nor the laws derived from the Talmud. They master only the minimum necessary to present themselves to people as following the Shulhan 'arukh. They also know nothing of the laws (dinim) found in the Zohar, as they do not study them.87 Hasidic leaders justify these practices, claiming that they have no time for study because of their lengthy preparations for prayer and their numerous purifications in the ritual bath. Ber maintains, however, that hasidim all spend time smoking long pipes (lulki), which he compares to offering up smoke to the devil.88 Dov Ber also discusses the amount of time that hasidim devote to prayer. It is true, he says, that the Talmud describes very pious figures who delay their prayers by an hour to prepare themselves (B. Berakhot 32a), but Ber believes that hasidim take this concept too far. He notes that they delay their morning prayers, and finish their afternoon prayers only when the stars come out, "which is contrary to the rulings of the Shulhan 'arukh." Ber then expends several lines about the unique authority of Karo's codification of the halakhah. It is striking that in these lines he does not refer to the work of Moshe Isserles. Returning to the hasidim, Ber is skeptical about the purity of their motivation in neglecting long-established customs: "One wishes that their purpose were for the sake of the fear of heaven and not the prideful performance of their piety."89 He then describes how hasidic rabbis travel in long caravans with an entourage of attendants. Many students run before them, praising them before the foolish masses and declaring how remarkably pious these leaders are. He states that men, women, and children are attracted to hasidic leaders who claim the ability to reveal secrets, and know what the future will bring: And the masses of the People of Israel whose fear exceeds their wisdom are troubled and afraid because of the sins that each carries. They are afraid that their transgressions will be revealed in public. [Therefore,] they, their wives, and their children, bring gifts and presents and ask for [the leader's] blessing.90 It is true, he says, that those who lead the prayers of the hasidim have excellent voices.91 And it is admissible to praise a person for this quality because it is 86.

Other praises that are said of them, however, are forbid den, including those that extol their spiritual prayers, their mortifications, their fasting from Sabbath to Sabbath, the fact that they eat nothing that has been living {she-'einam okhlim shum davar meha-hay)92 and that through many immersions they have renewed themselves and emerged free of all impurity.93 What troubles the author about these praises is their dependence on the faith of the person who hears them. This passage alone contains the word praise (shevah) fourteen times. The book In Praise of the Baal Shem Tov (Shivhe ha-Besht) appeared in print more than a decade after Dov Ber completed his own book, but manuscripts of Shivhe ha-Besht were certainly in circulation long before the text found its way into print. Perhaps this passage in Divre binah is an allusion to that work. Dov Ber grants that many praises were said of the "first" hasidim (i.e., before Beshtian Hasidism), such as for drawing out their prayers for many hours, reciting the kavanot of Isaac Luria, for leading prayers with sweet voices, and for the practice of many penitential acts according to teshuvat ha-kanah94 These earlier pious persons, however, were humble and modest, and did not attack the authority of any scholar. Dov Ber states that such is not the case of the hasidim of his own time. In recent years, hasidim have come to lack modesty and humility, and do not follow the requirements of penitential practice.95 Most even ignore the fasts auth orized by the rabbis and our ancestors. Their prayers are short because they do not recite the kavanot of Isaac Luria;96 they do not study the laws of the Talmud or the rulings of the Shulhan arukh, nor are they interested in midrash or Aggadah and the relevant commentaries, and they avoid the Zohar. In addition, their hutspah increases daily to the extent that they disparage the rabbis of the communities of Israel. 92. This refers to a penitential practice known as teshuvat ha-kanah. In Sefer ha-kanah (Krakow, 1894 [1st ed., Prague, 1610]), 12a, we read, "One should eat only sufficient bread to sustain life, cut oneself off from social contact, and from meat and from wine and from all living things and things that come from all living things." On p. 129 of the same book, the author presents "The Secret of Who Is Permitted to Eat Meat." See Yisra'el Ta-Shma, "Hekhan nithabru sifre ha-kanah veha-peli'ah?" in Perakim be-toledot ha-hevrah ha-yehudit bi-mei ha-benayim uva-et ha-hadashah, ed. I. Etkes et al. (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1980), 56-63; Steven Bowman, "Mi hiber et Sefer ha-kanah, \t-Sefer ha-Peli'ah?" Tarbiz 54 (1985): 150-52; Michal Oron, "Mihu mehaber Sefer ha-peli'ah \e-Sefer ha-kanah?

Salomon Maimons Lebensgechichte, 168, 170-71; Haye Shelomoh Maimon, 121: the story of a certain scholar who performed teshuvat ha-kanah ... and ate nothing that has been living "meat, milk, honey, and the like." 93.

For example, it was solely because of the hasidic presence that the great scholar Meshulam left his post as rabbi of Tysmienica to accept a position in Pressburg.97 In sum, Dov Ber's remarks on Hasidism are based in part on personal impressions he gained in Lwow. He clearly perceives that Hasidism is a new phenomenon, although the lines, established by historians, between the old-style hassidim and the Beshtian form are not entirely clear in his presentation. We might say, pending more systematic collection of source evidence, that in the eyes of observers in the last decades of the eighteenth century, the full distinctive ness of Hasidism from other paths had not yet been established.98 A good many of the complaints found in antihasidic literature in the late eighteenth century are not mentioned in Divre binah. There are no references to the hasidic mode of animal slaughter, to ecstatic prayer or separate places of prayer, to the wearing of white robes, or to the bans of excommunication against hasidim. Ber's complaints focus on the neglect of study of the revealed Torah, disrespect for the learned rabbis, teaching Kabbalah to the uninitiated, fri volity, not praying at the correct time and omitting the kavanot, and failures in penitence for sins. He implies that hasidic leaders are tricksters and confidence men, but he does not elaborate on this characteristic to a great extent. Afterword: Dov Ber in context The significance of these first pages of Divre binah, particularly if read along with the author's Memoirs, is that they give us a window onto the outlook of a well-established and successful merchant in the Lwow region. He writes as a person of advanced years?in his seventies?and displays the conser vatism natural to a man of his age and status. Consequently, his views reflect his discomfort with the changes afoot in his time, among them the new Hasidism, and manifestations of disbelief. His preoccupation, from the years of his youth, with defending Judaism and particularly the Oral Tradition against Christian attack is prominent in the material under discussion. Before attempting to determine whether one might justifiably link Dov Ber to the Haskalah or to the early Haskalah,99 perhaps it would be best to analyze his emphases in the introductory pages of Divre binah. There are four central motifs here: the confrontation with Christianity and with Christian attacks on Jews and 97. Ibid., 29-30. The reference is to Meshulam ben Shimshon Igra (1742-1801), who left Tys mienica in 1793. The move to the much more prestigious Hungarian community may well have been motivated by factors other than the attacks of hasidim. It is true, though, that when he left Galicia, Igra sent a letter to the elders of the communities of Brody and Lwow attacking Hasidism. David of Makow published this letter in his antihasidic tract Shever posHim. Wilensky, Hasidim u-mitnaggedim, 1:177 79. The letter does not say that its author left Tysmienica because of the hasidim. 98. Cf. Ada Rapoport-Albert, "Hasidism after 1772," in Hasidism Reappraised (London: Val lentine Mitchell, 1996), 76-140. 99. For this distinction, see, e.g., Shmuel Feiner, "Ha-haskalah ha-mukdemet be-yahadut ha-me'ah ha-shemoneh-esreh," Tarbiz 67 (1998): 189-240; idem, Mahapekhat ha-ne'orut: Tenuat ha-haskalah ha-yehudit ba-me'ah ha-18 (Jerusalem: Merkaz Zalman Shazar, 2002), 39-109. 246</page><page sequence="23">The Introduction to Divre binah by Dov Ber of Bolechow Judaism; the confrontation with the new Austrian regime and Ber's proposals for restoring communal autonomy; the confrontation with Hasidism in all its forms and with the preoccupation with Kabbalah; and the defense of the tradition and traditional learning in the face of Hasidism, and, more importantly, with various forms of doubt and unbelief Roughly equivalent amounts of space?about thir teen pages each?are given to each of the latter two motifs. The polemic with Christianity occupies only about nine pages, though these are placed at the begin ning of the book.100 In addition, about six pages are devoted to Ber's suggestions for maintaining both communal autonomy and an independent and powerful Jewish judicial system?the rabbinate.101 The similarity between the early passages in the book and certain lines in Mdaseh Tuvyah is noted earlier. In Ber's telling of the attacks of the nations who claim that true wisdom has vanished from among the Jews, he states, without attribution, the words of Tuvyah Kohen. He sets them, however, in a different context, suggesting that these interlocutors focus on the Talmud, and then proceeds to say that ultimately the Christians will vanish from the earth, fol lowing the path of idolaters in the past: "neither the nations nor the names of their gods are remembered by any person. The enemies of God who follow lying reli gions will be forgotten in just the same way."102 Tuvyah finds that rabbinic litera ture does not provide a satisfying answer to his Christian challengers?we were weak in our debates with them, he says. This stimulates the Polish-born physician not to rest until he has composed a work that shows how wisdom has been given not only to them, "but... among us also, there are wise men."103 In contrast, Ber's stance is quite different, more confident and assertive, and much less given to a feeling of inferiority than Tuvyah's. For historians wishing to classify the author as a maskil or early maskil, the passage under consideration here presents a set of contradictory behaviors and atti tudes. On the one hand, Dov Ber had studied European languages and showed considerable respect for European scholarship. He composed his works in Hebrew in a style unblemished by the heavily ornate and allusive characteristics of some of his contemporaries. He seems to have had special admiration for Sephardic scholars (virtually all the authors he cites are Sephardic).104 And although the passages about Joseph II and the "flight of the demons" might seem to suggest that, to the author, a new era had begun, there is no support for this idea elsewhere in the text. Dov Ber's remarks on communal organization and the rabbinate, on the other hand, are distinctly conservative. The notion that intellectuals deserve to lead the community alongside or in place of the traditional rabbinate finds no expression here. On the contrary, he wants to free the rabbinate from state interference and restore its traditional role. He expresses no special faith 100. Confrontation with Christianity: 3-7, 9-13; confrontation with Hasidism and Kabbalah: 22-29, 31-36; defense of the tradition and confrontation with unbelief: 17-22, 30, 42^8. 101.

There is, moreover, no hint that Dov Ber advocated programs for educational, economic, or communal reform. In short, the introductory pages of Divre binah reflect the conservative outlook of an elderly, successful merchant who was pained by some of the changes and developments in his society. Unusual, but far from unique, in posses sing a knowledge of European languages, Dov Ber wanted to restore traditional values and traditional leadership forms to his contemporaries and was confident that he had the intellectual wherewithal, provided to him by Jewish sources, with which to answer the challenges of Christians and doubting Jews. Thus, some thing undefined had changed, and he felt himself, consequently, obliged to seek to clarify an agenda for his time.

He uses dots placed between words, at the level of the upper-dot in a colon, to indicate some sort of division, usually when the words at the ends of the phrases rhyme. He uses what looks like a colon to mark the end of a paragraph.
