Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1993. xi, 273 pp. At the end of World War II, more than 30 million people found themselves displaced in various parts of Europe, especially in the central region. These included prisoners-of-war, concentration camp survivors and oppressors, slave laborers in German factories, and a motley assortment of others. Within a few months of V-E Day, May 8, 1945, most had been repatriated, but a hard core of about a million remained dislocated. The numbers changed daily as people left or entered various countries while others just wandered aimlessly. The Allied forces did a superb job of helping people return to their homes, but were less successful in accommodating the hundreds of thousands of Balts, Ukrainians, Poles, Jews, Hungarians, Romanians, and other East Europeans who wanted to be resettled elsewhere. Makeshift assembly centers, many of which had been concentration or prisoner-of-war camps, housed most of these people. The Allies had foreseen this problem during the war and had established UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) to help care for those who remained behind. Unfortunately, because of lack of leadership, personnel, and financing, as well as difficult relations with the military forces, UNRRA operations were chaotic. Several voluntary agencies from Europe and the United States also helped with the DPs (displaced persons), but the efforts of some of them were also less than satisfactory for the same reasons that plagued UNRRA. The American Jewish voluntary agencies like JDC (American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee) and HIAS (Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society) were probably the best of the lot and the most successful once they were allowed to work with the DPs, but they, too, had problems both with UNRRA and the American military. Although over 80 percent of their number were Christians, the DPs were at first perceived en masse as being Jewish, and consequently in the United States only Jews seemed interested in helping them. After the war ended in 1945 other nations were just as reluctant to take DPs, and only gradually did their policies change. It was generally acknowledged, however, that not until the United States undertook some major effort to aid these people would the problem subside. Haim Genizi's impressively researched and well-written work on this</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 453 subject, America's Fair Share, covers the details of the situation from the European scene through resettlement in the United States. He examines the agencies and problems involved, the various internecine wars between the military and the voluntary agencies, and the conflicts that arose within the agencies themselves. He is particularly good at showing how it was not until 1947, when the fact that most of the DPs were Christians became generally known, that American Catholic and Protestant groups joined in the effort to bring DPs to the United States. After an intensive struggle, especially on the part of the Citizens Commit- tee on Displaced Persons (CCDP), the lobbying agency established to win the nation's and congressional support for new legislation, Congress passed the Displaced Persons Acts of 1948 and 1950, which ultimately allowed 400,000 Europeans into the United States. Jewish groups wanted to bar ex-Nazis, gentiles seemed indifferent to this issue; in its legislation Congress facilitated the arrival of thousands, if not tens or hundreds of thousands, who had once supported Hitler's policies. Genizi's book is not the first treatment of the DPs. The reviewer produced America and the Survivors of the Holocaust in 1982, and Mark Wyman's DP: Europe's Displaced Persons, 1945-1951 appeared in 1989. America's Fair Share is best in revealing the statistics (numbers of people helped and monies expended by different groups) compiled by the various organizations and in summarizing the individual workings of the voluntary and church agencies involved in bringing DPs into the United States. Genizi is a gentleman and is therefore gentle in his criticism of maladministrators and bigots. He never says how much antisemitism affected American policies toward the DPs, but he leaves no doubt about its significant impact. This is a professionally done work, reflecting enormously deep research on the author's part. Genizi covers the topic broadly and adequately. America's Fair Share thus provides a good introduction to the subject of DPs and their resettlement in the United States. Leonard Dinnerstein University of Arizona Tucson, Ariz.</page></plain_text>
