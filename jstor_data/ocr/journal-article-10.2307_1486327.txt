<plain_text><page sequence="1">David B. Ruderman, The World of a Renaissance Jew: The Life and Thought of Abraham ben Mordecai Farissol. Monographs of the Hebrew Union College, no. 6. Cincinnati, 1981. xvii, 265 pp. In the past two or three decades, the number of subjects considered appropriate for historical inquiry has greatly increased. While historians were once concerned almost exclusively with succeeding generations of elites and towering intellectual and political figures, they now pursue avidly the study of much "humbler" folk. Similarly, social groups and categories like "the family" and "children" have become the historian's legitimate domain. Jewish historians have proved themselves no exception to this trend. Nevertheless, at least with reference to the premodern periods of Jewish history, and with one or two recent and notable exceptions, much still remains to be said about that group which has traditionally been so prepon- derant and so representative of the Jewish totality, the "bourgeoisie" or "middle class." An important step toward the understanding of bourgeois Jewish life has now been taken by David Ruderman's penetrating analysis of the life and works of Abraham ben Mordecai Farissol. Copier of manuscripts and teacher of chidren, .azzan and mohel, student of science and astrological dabbler, and frequenter of humanistic and Christian Hebraist circles, including that of Pico della Mirandola in Florence and Ferrara at the end of the fifteenth and in the early decades of the sixteenth century, Farissol was a quintessentially middle-class and, if you will, middle-brow type. This study of his life, accordingly, provides us with a distinct view of the middle-class world of Renaissance Jewish Italy, its goals, its hopes, and its anxieties. Neither a philosopher, university professor, rabbi, nor, at the other</page><page sequence="2">288 BOOK REVIEWS extreme, a publicist, Farissol might be best described as a perennially aspiring intellectual and scholar. Still, his achievements were by no means slight. Conversant with the ideas and work of contemporary secular litera- ture, as well as with the staples of Jewish tradition, and with good contacts at all levels of society, both Jewish and non-Jewish, Farissol could attain a measure of respect and assert his presence effectively in influential circles. The audience Farissol consciously addressed, moreover, was broadly based. He wrote for and responded to the needs of those hundreds (or was it thousands?) of Italian Jews who felt the stimulus, challenge, and threat of the Renaissance-pre-Reformation world and who asked the fundamental question of how they could deal with this world, indeed, imbibe from it, yet still remain steadfast in their Jewish identity. Hence, Ruderman writes on p. 145: "To the extent that Farissol wrote to inform the entire Jewish commu- nity, his life and thought provide a greater insight into the impact of Renais- sance culture on a wide cross-section of that community than do the works of other intellectuals, whose audiences were restricted to learned circles, whether Jewish or Christian." The Renaissance world, moreover, was a deceptive one, willing in some cases, as Ruderman explains, to see in the individual Jew a person and human being, but also holding on staunchly to the medieval conception of the accursed Jewish people. The French humanist Francois Tissard could show respect for Farissol, his teacher of Hebrew. However, through Hebraism and the exploitation of the Kabbalah, Tissard also hoped to achieve Farissol's conversion. Farissol could distinguish between what was primary and what was secondary to his own identity. Familiar. with, although not immersed in, the writings of Maimonides and Gersonides, as well as those of contemporary Renaissance Aristotelians, he warned in his polemical tract Magen A vraham against an overrationalized, spiritualized, or mystified understanding of Judaism. He argued, rather, for the acceptance of the sanctity of the Torah and the avoidance of rarefied philosophical inquiry. Likewise, he pointed to the plight of those who had fallen victim to the lures of Christian kabbalistic interpretations: their conversion to Christianity had too often led to disap- pointment, rejection, and despair. More importantly, as Ruderman methodically demonstrates-in chapter after chapter based on a thorough study of each of the problems he discusses, first in its general Renaissance and then in its Renaissance-Jewish aspects-Farissol was able to take the Christian argument and make of it a "two-edged sword." If Christians relied on biblical texts, then he would</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 289 show, as part of the developed Renaissance critique of the Vulgate transla- tion, that the very proof-texts used by Christian debaters were incorrectly understood and hence unreliable for polemics. If Christian economists were beginning to expand the definition of licit profits, moving toward the accep- tance of openly charged interest rates which occurred first in the early seventeenth century, then Farissol would anticipate their arguments with a similar argument of his own. Here indeed Farissol was truly innovative. And if discoveries in the New World made Christians dream of a coming perfec- tion of all mankind, then Farissol, in his pioneering geography, Iggeret Orhot Olam, would show that a study of geography and natural phenomena could substantially reinforce traditional Jewish teachings. Throughout Farissol's writings, furthermore, there is a constant assertion that Judaism stands up well to the challenge of magic, astrology, messianic speculation, and even humanist rationalism. In the tradition of so much of Jewish litera- ture, therefore, Farissol's writings may be seen together as a grand essay at consolation: We have met the enemy, on his terms, and we are not his. But to whom was Farissol directing this consolation, and why? As noted above, Ruderman-who, in fact, stops short of using terms like "consola- tion" and "consolation literature"--argues correctly that Farissol was addressing himself to a broad segment of the Jewish populace intrigued with Renaissance culture and, uniquely, given the chance to participate in it in the "enlightened" (p. 44) and "generally hospitable" (p. 3) atmosphere of the times. Such a group of (proto-bourgeois) Jews undoubtedly existed, and in large numbers. This is evidenced by, among other things, the popularized philosophy and mysticism present in the faith-strengthening sermons of (later sixteenth century) preachers like Menahem Raba or, mutatis mutandis, in the low-key intellectual missionary letter of Ludovico Carrito (formerly Yosef Shacki) to his sons. Farissol's audience also included Jewish lenders and bankers. Farissol had close relations with this group, and his defense of interest-taking met one of its immediate needs in the same way that the contemporary Eternal Life of Yehiel da Pisa chided one of its excesses, the taking of interest from fellow Jews. Just because, therefore, this incipient Jewish middle class did exist, and just because Ruderman's portrayal of Farissol is so thorough, one would have liked to see some attempt to bridge the gap between the individual and the collectivity by discussing this body of Jews directly rather than only by general references to it. This discussion would have added immeasurably to the appreciation of Farissol's own importance. The question of the social climate in which Farissol wrote is more</page><page sequence="4">290 BOOK REVIEWS problematic. The humanists may have been humane to individual Jews, yet, as Ruderman himself notes carefully, there was a countercurrent in the religious ideals of the time. It manifested itself, first, in unceasing and strenuous calls for the elimination of the Jewish danger to society, and, second, through libels and open assaults. The many efforts to convert the Jews "through (Augustinian) kindness" characteristic of the early sixteenth century, that is, in Farissol's immediate day, only masked the determination of what was probably the majority to rid itself of the Jews, either through elimination, by means of expulsion and pogroms, or through total integra- tion, by means of mass conversion. If Farissol was as sensitive to intellectual currents as Ruderman has shown he undoubtedly was, then he must have been no less sensitive to the explosive social moods, especially the religious mood, of his day. And thus it is likely that Farissol's writings, with their message of consolation, were not merely the response of a Jew quickened and challenged by Gentile society, and, on occasion, even made solicitous of the beliefs and feelings of its individual members. They were, beyond that, the response of a Jew conditioned by a (correct) sense of impending up- heaval (as occurred in Italian Jewish life from the mid-sixteenth century and onward), or, at the least, by a sense of malaise which he shared with so many others of his ilk, and for whom he was writing. In the "Conclusion," Ruder- man does point to these problems. He notes, first, that "dissonances rather than compatibility underlay the supposedly congruous relationship between the two [Jewish and Christian] cultures," and he goes on to speak of the "inherent threat to Jewish existence" that Renaissance culture posed. In the body of the book, however, most of the emphasis is placed on the "new climate of greater tolerance and polite regard" (p. 80) in which Farissol was able to live and work. The existence of such a climate is by no means certain. David Ruderman's book is, thus, most stimulating. It not only reveals in all its depth the personal world of a man like Abraham Farissol, but it also raises important questions (not unknown to twentieth-century Jews, for that matter) of how the Jewish middle class in the Renaissance was able to perceive and effectively grapple with the feelings and direction of Christian society at a moment when an outwardly deceptive calm belied an ominous underlying challenge. One final note: the erudition of the notes is vast, in both quantity and quality. Ruderman is, moreover, to be complimented on his editorial judgment in consigning the technical discussion of manuscripts and editions of Farissol's works to notes and appendices. It is thus regrettable that the</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 291 notes were gathered together at the back of the book with no key enabling the reader to pass rapidly from the text to the notes. The author of this fine book was done a signal disservice. Kenneth R. Stow University of Haifa Haifa, Israel</page></plain_text>
