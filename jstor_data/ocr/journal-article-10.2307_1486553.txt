Yeshayahu Maori's important monograph treats the subject of the in- fluence of Jewish exegesis on the Peshitta Pentateuch with a rare degree of expertise. It is a revision of his doctoral dissertation written under the direction of Prof. M. H. Goshen-Gottstein 5"1 at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The study will be of interest to students of the history of exegesis, of the ancient versions of the Hebrew Bible, and of midrash, and to lexicographers of Hebrew and Syriac. While the fact that it is written in Hebrew may deter many potential readers, the excellent indices can readily direct readers whose Hebrew knowledge is limited to discussions of texts which interest them. The volume contains an English title page and table of contents in addition to Hebrew ones. Maori's study differs from previous research on the subject in scope and methodology. With regard to scope, Maori cites and discusses all relevant cases, rather than an ad hoc selection of examples. With regard to method- ology, he formulates criteria by which to evaluate agreements between the Peshitta (hereafter P) and the Jewish exegetical sources. Simple agreements between P and the Jewish sources are not enough to claim influence, whether direct or indirect. For this study, Maori excludes the Targums and the LXX from his Jewish exegetical sources, since a comparison of P with any one of them could comprise a monograph in itself. He does, however, reference them wherever relevant. Further, in chapter 11 he offers an extensive introduction to the problems involved in such comparisons. While Maori's dissertation research preceded the publication of the Leiden critical edition of P to Genesis-Deuteronomy, he used the Mosul edition for his research, checking against MS 7al, the primary witness of the Leiden edition. His citations are according to MS 7al. For this revision, he verified his citations against the Leiden edition and checked the variants for possible influence, especially those found in MS 5bl to Genesis and Exodus. Before establishing criteria by which to judge the influence of rabbinic exegesis on P, Maori demonstrates that P offers nonliteral renderings not dependent on rabbinic thought. Reasons for deviating from the MT include the requirements of the target language Syriac, the influence of parallel passages, and a variant Hebrew text. With regard to harmonizations, Maori believes that they may have been introduced by the translator. It seems more</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 251 likely, however, that they either reflect a variant Hebrew text or entered the text as inner-Syriac developments during transmission due to scribal activity (as interlinear or marginal notes which later entered the text). Maori offers several criteria by which to establish Jewish exegetical influence on P, including deviation from the normal translation equivalents found in similar passages, verbatim equivalence with the rabbinic sources, and identification of geographic names and peoples. To his credit and to our profit, he points out that agreements between P and Jewish sources may have come about because of P's influence on them! Midrash Bereshit Zota, for example, quotes extensively from P, according to Maori (p. 81). In short, every case of agreement between P and the Jewish sources needs to be scrutinized before we pass judgment. Chapter 6 comprises a sequential listing of all cases where, in the opinion of Maori, P was influenced by rabbinic exegesis. Each case is examined in detail. Page references are given for cases treated elsewhere in the book, for easy access. In chapter 7, Maori demonstrates convincingly that inconsistent word choice by P was at times determined by Jewish exegesis. It is evident in nonliteral renderings, like br 'ns' "person" for Hebrew nps, which can include both people and animals in Exod 12:16, and yhwdy' for Hebrew 'bry in the collocation 'bd 'bry in Exod 21:2, to let the reader understand that the text is speaking about a slave who is a Hebrew, not a slave belonging to a Hebrew who might be a non-Hebrew. Even in literal renderings P's choice of words could be guided by Jewish exegetical traditions. P renders the Hebrew noun kdper as mmwn ' and not as swwhd' only in Exod 21:30 in agreement with the Jewish exegetical sources, because the verse speaks of actually giving money. In chapter 8, Maori suggests that P occasionally uses a Syriac word with a non-Syriac meaning under the influence of rabbinic exegesis. In Deut 32:10, for example, P uses the root nqp to render Hebrew sbb with the meaning "to encircle." The problem is that while in Hebrew and Targumic Aramaic nqp means "to encircle," in Syriac it means "to adhere to." The non-Syriac use of nqp in P probably points to the influence of a midrash well known to the translator, either written or fixed in oral teaching. In chapter 10, Maori ventures to offer cases that suggest rabbinic influ- ence but for which no source exists. These cases may indicate nonextant midrashim. In sum, Maori is well informed and offers extensive examples.
