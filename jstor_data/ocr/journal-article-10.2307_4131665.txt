LITERARY REPRESENTATIONS OF THE AMERICAN RABBI by Wendy Zierler "It is impossible to assess the nature of the Jewish community in the land [America] without looking at the spiritual countenance of its generation of rabbis." _-Reuven Gordis' The Haskalah of the late eighteenth century, it is often observed, dealt a major blow to many traditional Ashkenazic institutions, including the rabbinate.2 Formerly extolled by their communities in nearly God-like superlatives-such as "Chief shepherd, a dignitary in the land ... Prince among princes in Torah and wisdom"3-rabbis became the object of trenchant criticism during this period.4 The maskilim, formerly denizens of the yeshivot, cast special aspersion on rabbis and their assertion of the authority of Jewish law, charging that the rabbinic insistence on stringencies and legal minutiae was the source of all that was wrong with Diaspora Jewish life. Much of the critique of the rabbinate targeted the culture of yeshiva learning that supported it; the maskilim promoted the study of philos- ophy, science, Hebrew literature, and the scientific study of Judaism.

Katz links the alteration of the status of the rabbi to "two corresponding processes. One of these was the growing intervention of the respective governments in the affairs of the Jewish commu- nities, undermining the autonomy on which the authority of the rabbis depended. The other was the emergence of a group of people within communities who, relying on their own judgment, contested the prerogative of rabbis to control the religious conduct of their congregants."

In the realm of literary expression, this maskilic critique of the rabbinate found perhaps its most trenchant expression in Yehuda Leib Gordon's controver- sial mock-epic poem "Kozo shel yod" (1878), the story of a virtuous heroine named Bat-Shua (literally, daughter of salvation) who, instead of being saved by Jewish law, is rendered an 'agunah (chained wife) by the misguided decision of a rabbi who nullifies the get (divorce document) sent by her husband Hillel because his name is written in the document without a yod. This decision rep- resents a Halakhic stringency that threatens to destroy the pintele yid, commonly understood as the spark or essence of the Jew. Though he is praised as a glorious genius, this rabbi "has none of the praiseworthy traits/that were excellent among the Holy Seed, the sons of the covenant." In contrast to the preamble of the fore- going contract, in which the rabbi receives praise knowing "forty-nine ways to purify the reptile and to render it impure," Gordon's Ray Vafsi knows only "to destroy and ban, to make 'treif and forbid."5 Gordon's satirical depiction is highly exaggerated and controversial; however, its basic distrust of the traditional rabbinate and its treatment of women (and maskilim) typify the literature of this period.6 As David Roskies writes in his discussion of Yiddish literary representations of the rabbi during this period, "For the young, second-generation rebels of Jewish Eastern Europe, the only usable past was a rebellious past. Rabbis for the time being, were unsal- vageable, both because they were the sworn guardians of ultraconservative Tradition and because the rebellion against them was in full swing."' To be sure, modernity also spawned alternative religious movements within Judaism and new, usable versions of the rabbinate. German Jewry witnessed the rise of Reform Judaism and the Rabbiner, the rabbi as preacher and as intellectual, com- mitted to the strict and precise discipline of historical research, of Wissenschaft des 5.

Roskies goes on to discuss the ways in which modem Jewish writers have responded to the problem of the traditional rabbinate. Isaac Meir Dik, for example, uses what Roskies calls a "divide and conquer strategy," lampooning the rabbis of his own generation while venerating the rabbis of the past (69). Rabbis make "cameo appearances" in the writings of S. Y. Abramovitsh and are repeatedly eclipsed by his Mendele the Book Peddler (70). I. L. Peretz gives literary veneration to hasidic rabbis, but these rabbis are part of a world that is more legendary than actual. 256</page><page sequence="3">Literary Representations of the American Rabbi Judentums.8 The loss of rabbinic, judicial authority thus gave rise to other kinds of rabbinic specialization and proficiency aimed at restoring the honor and gravity of the position. These brief remarks on the status and nature of the rabbinate in modem Europe provide a useful background for an investigation of how rabbis are rep- resented in twentieth- and twenty-first-century American Jewish literature. What happened when the rabbinate and its relevant institutions migrated across the seas and took root in American soil? To what extent does the rebellious European attitude about the "unsalvageability" of the rabbinate, as described by Roskies, persist in American Jewish literature? Conversely, to what extent has the rabbinate been salvaged-even lauded--by American Jewish writers? In this paper, I will focus first on a line of writers who continue to emphasize the unsalvageability of the rabbinate in modem times. I will then turn to a countertradition that begins to reimagine the rabbinate and includes new trends that feature women as rabbis. If the modem maskilic attack on the rabbinate foregrounds the position of women in Judaism, these recent works carry on this concern for women's issues but look at the way these issues have been addressed in a postmodern climate in which women have begun to don and refashion the mantle of leadership. EARLY TWENTIETH-CENTURY PORTRAITS In 1917, a Baltimore attorney and novelist named Sydney L. Nyburg (1880- 1957) published a novel called The Chosen People, which tells the story of a young, newly ordained Reform rabbi named Philip Graetz, who is hired straight out of Hebrew Union College to minister to a large, wealthy Reform Temple in Baltimore.9 Handsome, earnest, charismatic, and committed to the rationalistic principles of Reform Judaism-with a last name that points to the intellectual legacy of the foremost Jewish historian of modem times (Heinrich Graetz, 1817-91)-Graetz assumes his position with "noble enthusiasm" and a naive albeit well-meaning mission to be "God's prophet."'0 When a labor strike erupts in Baltimore, pitting eastern European Jewish labor against German Jewish factory owners-the latter all members of Graetz's temple-Philip soon discovers how difficult it is to effect social change and to instill within his 8.

Though he is thoroughly modem, acculturated, and intellectual, Philip Graetz, no less than his traditional counterparts, is a rabbi with no real authority and "commanding influence.""11 Philip's lack of rabbinic authority is underscored in the novel by his associ- ation with women. It is the women in his congregation who respond to his oratory and thrill to his exhortations. According to David Gordon, the practical-minded lawyer who eventually helps settle the strike, "The men don't care a rap about the Rabbi so long as he does nothing to make them uncomfortable."12 If an opposi- tion is drawn in the novel between religiosity, idealism, and femininity on one hand and practicality, realism, and masculinity on the other, then Rabbi Philip Graetz emerges as the most "effeminate" character in the book. In fact, the two women who are closest to Philip in the novel are consistently shown to be more realistic and astute about human affairs than he is. Early on in the story, we are introduced to an heiress named Ruth Hartman, who, in her pursuit of the rabbi's affections-everyone in the congregation assumes they will marry-plays the role of Sancho Panza to the rabbi's Don Quixote. Throughout the novel, Rabbi Graetz remains entirely oblivious to the extent of his powerlessness, not just before his industrialist (male) congregants but also before Ruth. Though eloquent and book smart, he is incapable of actualizing his prophetic ideals and goals. As one contemporary reviewer put it, "In the course of the story he gains great popularity and social recognition-but the glory he receives comes rather in spite of, than through, his own efforts."13 That said, Graetz is not unlikable, and we are not happy that he fails. Until the very last page of the novel, Nyburg depicts him as a man of integrity and good intention, ineffectuality notwithstanding. Such is not the case in Aben Kandel's 1931 novel Rabbi Burns, which offers a far less admiring and forgiving portrait of the modem American Reform rabbi. Kandel's Rabbi Moritz Bums-formerly known as Moishke Bemstein!-is a social "dynamo," all surface and no depth, all glitz and no God: He capitalized on his own youthful appearance, came before his audiences like a matinee idol in changes of costume, his charm unctuous, causing each buxom matron to thrill to his glances, intriguing the interest of the younger girls. He got along fine with the men because he was practical about his spiritual business. A preacher who is burdened with too much reli- gion, who looks, dresses, thinks, and preaches at right angles to his congrega- tion, is a source of discomfort. Rabbi Bums knew that a sheep in his pastorage wanted to be at ease, to laugh a little, play a great deal, learn a little, and in all be agreeably stimulated. After a hard week, selling real estate, or making moving pictures, no respectable worshipper can relish a sermon that 11. Ibid., 11.

For years he had dreamed of this Temple, the richest, the gaudiest, the most elaborate in all of America, a struc- ture to symbolize success, so lavish and so beautiful as to compare favorably with Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood.14 The image of the American rabbi that comes into view in Kandel's novel is that of the rabbi as Hollywood entertainer and producer of religion as spectacle.15 To communicate his disapproval of the idea of the performer rabbi, Kandel con- sistently juxtaposes Rabbi Bums against the scrappy image of a writer and journal- ist Adam Krasoff, who looks back nostalgically to Orthodoxy and to the basement shul of his childhood. And yet, Krasoff's own memories and descriptions point to Orthodox Judaism as a dying, socially marginal, and impoverished form-to use Roskies's term, "unsalvageable." As a child, Adam spent cold afternoons in heder, repeating "sing-song the meaningless words of the tired rabbi dreaming of a summer in a little village in Russia."'6 It is the rabbinate as performance rather than piety that thrives in this modem American West Coast social climate.17 Henry Roth's modernist classic Call It Sleep (1934) once again portrays the old basement shul and the rabbi as teacher presiding over his heder boys, but this time, there is no nostalgic patina coating the description. In Henry Roth's story about the psychological, spiritual, and artistic growth of David Schearl, no glory accrues to the disheveled and frankly abusive melammed, who is named Reb Yidel (literally, Rabbi Little Jew): While his mother and the rabbi were discussing the hours and the price and the manner of David's tuition, David scanned his future teacher more closely. He was not at all like his teachers at school, but David had seen rabbis before, and he knew he wouldn't be. He appeared old and was certainly untidy. He wore soft leather shoes like house slippers that had no place for either laces or buttons. His trousers were baggy and stained, a great area of striped and crumpled shirt intervened between his belt and his bulging vest. The knot of his tie, which was nearer one ear than the other, hung away from his soiled collar. What features were visible were large and had an oily gleam. Beneath his skull cap, his black hair was closely cropped. Though full of mis- givings about his future relations with the rabbi, David felt that he must accept his fate. Was it not his father's decree that he attend a cheder?'s Like David's abusive father, who wields a belt, the rabbi beats his students merci- lessly with a pointer, a perversion of the yad, an instrument used in Torah reading. 14.

The one saving grace of Roth's rabbi, then, is his ability to identify a gifted student. What to do with this gifted student is another matter, for if David is stirred by Isaiah, it is in spite of rather than because of Reb Yidel's style of pedagogy.19 Reb Yidel, the disrespected American melammed who longs for that once upon a time when rabbis inspired fear and awe in their disciples, looks back pruri- ently on his own teacher's habit of flogging students with their pants down. Over and over again, we return to the question of coercive authority and the crisis that besets the rabbinate when the rabbi's word is no longer solid, immovable law. PHILIP ROTH'S RABBINIC DESPOTS In mid-century, along comes Philip Roth, the rebel scribe from Newark, to tell us that Reb Yidel's longing for absolute rabbinic authority and his penchant for corporal punishment are alive and well in suburban New Jersey. In his 1959 story "The Conversion of the Jews," we find ourselves again in the basement classroom of a synagogue, this time to witness a dramatic clash between a thirteen-year-old boy named Oscar (Ozzie) Freedman and a New World incarnation of the rabbi- teacher, "Rabbi Marvin Binder, a tall, handsome, broad-shouldered man of thirty, with thick-fibered black hair" and a "monumental voice."20 Rabbi Binder may fancy himself open-minded, announcing to his students that "it's now free- discussion time ... Feel free to talk about any Jewish matter at all-religion, family, politics, sports."21 In reality, he is bound by and, in turn, binds his students to a very limited religious and educational viewpoint. Oscar Freedman, whose very name suggests a penchant for free thought, wants to know why God, creator of the world in six days, could not have "let a woman [Mary] have a 19. In this prophetic passage, Isaiah stands terrified: "Woe is me, for I am ruined: because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of people of unclean lips, for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of Hosts" (Isaiah 6:3-5). In response to this profession of uncleanness, one of the seraphim descends with a hot coal in his hand, which he lays upon Isaiah's lips to purify him. In Roth's novel, David Schearl is an Isaiah-like visionary, surrounded by people who speak a crude immigrant dialect riddled with profanities; he is entranced by this biblical passage and its paradoxical depiction of the dirty black coal that both sullies and gives off light. As Bonnie Lyons observes, for David, "the rabbi himself embodies these contrasting qualities. He is physically repulsive ... Moreover, he is abusive to his students, almost to the point of sadism. Nonetheless, it is the rabbi who recognizes David's extraordinary nature, who compliments him for his "iron head" (217) and calls him a "true Yiddish child" (212).

When, against his own best judgment, Ozzie blurts out that Rabbi Binder does not "know anything about God," Rabbi Binder smacks his face and gives him a bloody nose.22 So much for free discussion. The story climaxes with Oscar Freedman on the synagogue roof threatening to jump. Ordering Ozzie to come down from the roof, Rabbi Binder assumes the pose of a "dictator, pointing one arm stiffly up" at Ozzie and "at the end of that arm, one finger aimed menacingly." But by the end of the story, Ozzie-the Jewish kid lured by Christian America-manages to humble the rabbinic despot, compelling him to kneel in the Christian prayer position and concede that God can indeed make a woman pregnant without intercourse.23 The rabbi as dictator resurfaces in a more sinister guise in Philip Roth's recent novel The Plot against America (2004) in the figure of Rabbi Lionel Bengelsdorf. Despite all his learning, Jewish and otherwise, this rabbi of Roth's imagining, a cabinet member in the Nazi-sympathizing administration of President Charles Lindbergh, is deeply misguided about just about everything that matters. In his creation of Rabbi Bengelsdorf, Roth shows himself to be even more suspi- cious and derisive toward American rabbis than he was forty-five years ago. For if we are meant to laugh at Rabbi Binder, we are meant to loathe the aristocratic, grandiloquent, polyglot, and dangerously obtuse Bengelsdorf. As Roth writes, My Uncle Monty, who hated all rabbis but had an especially venomous loath- ing of Bengelsdorf dating back to his childhood as a charity student in the B'nai Moshe religious school, liked to say of him, "The pompous son of a bitch knows everything-it's too bad he doesn't know anything else."24 SALVAGING THE AMERICAN RABBI Based on the survey of literary portraits of the rabbi presented thus far, a conviction seems to emerge that not much has changed in the representation of the rabbi since the early critique of Y. L. Gordon. The unsalvageability of the rabbi appears to be an enduring literary fact of modem Jewish and Jewish American literature. It is important to acknowledge, however, a literary-historical line that runs counter to the one I have sketched out so far. Indeed, several American Jewish writers have reflected more positively on the possibilities for the rabbinate in the modem and postmodem age. A story titled "Malinke's Atone- ment" by immigrant writer Mary Antin (1881-1949), author of the now-classic memoir The Promised Land, serves as the first example in this counterhistory. Mary Antin made a literary career of explaining the ways of Russian Jewish immigrants to WASP readers and arguing, on the basis of her own immigrant success and the shared values of Jews and Christian Americans, that America 22. Ibid., 146. 23. Ibid., 148. 24. Philip Roth, The Plot against America (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2004), 35. 261</page><page sequence="8">Wendy Zierler should maintain an open-door immigration policy. In her memoir, she writes frankly about the parochial nature of Jewish life in Russia and Poland and the limitations placed on the educational aspirations of girls and women in that community; these deficient aspects of Old World Jewish life help her make the case for America as a promised land of education.25 "Malinke's Atonement," first published in the Atlantic Monthly in 1911, departs from some of the patterns of the memoir insofar as it imagines New World transformations in an Old World setting.26 In the story, the protagonist, Malinke, is sent by her mother to Rav Nossen, the town rabbi, for a ruling on whether their newly slaughtered chicken, discov- ered with a wire in its stomach, is kosher or treif When the rabbi rules that it is treif, Malinke lies to her mother and says that it is kosher. Later, she bitterly regrets this lie and takes it upon herself to engage in dramatic acts of confession and contrition that, in turn, precipitate a change of mind on the part of Rav Nossen, who admits that [t]here was a great mistake, a great mistake. No man has the right to give judgment who does not know his people. A wise teacher is like a physician, who has one medicine for the strong, and another for the weak. The Law must be read with one eye on the scroll, and another on the world, lest the Torah become a writ of bondage and the pent people rebel. The rabbi alone cannot keep the Torah holy. The people must be with him, and he with them.27 Antin's likening of Rav Nossen to a physician is significant insofar as elsewhere in modern Jewish literature, the rabbi is blamed for all that ails the community.28 Antin imagines a rabbi who changes his mind and his ruling, thereby healing 25.

Not only does he forgive Malinke's transgression, he also takes it upon himself to offer her private Torah instruction to correct her "defective" education. Antin thus projects her own story of secular American edu- cational success onto an Old World background, imagining a shtetl girl who is rewarded for her intellectual acumen and independence and a traditional rabbi who is god fearing yet liberal, resolute and yet flexible, traditional and yet suppor- tive of women's education. The significance of this story becomes even greater when Antin's depiction of Reb Nossen is contrasted with Anzia Yezierska's depic- tion of Reb Smolinsky, the misogynist scholar of Anzia Yezierska's novel Bread Givers (1925) who thwarts his youngest daughter's intellectual ambitions at every possible turn. In "Malinke's Atonement," Antin makes a case for Rav Nossen as the exemplary Jew, the scholar, saint, and teacher who stands for what is best in Jewish law and thought. Through the example of Rav Nossen, she attempts to show that Old World Jews are not backward, superstitious obscurantists but forward thinking, adaptable, rational, ethical people-in short, excellent future citizens. For those Christian Americans who would view Jews as heartless devo- tees to the letter rather than the spirit of the law, Antin writes, "The sacred office of rav endows him [the rabbi] with considerable latitude. ... The Jews law was not meant to oppress God's chosen people. It was meant to keep them clean, by guard- ing them against every disease of mind and body. In the mouths of wise and liberal scholars, it can be interpreted in two words: Be pure."29 THE INVENTION OF RABBI SMALL In the next few decades of American Jewish literature, few other writers chose to plead the cause of Judaism or the immigrant Jew through the agency of a rabbi protagonist. In the writings of Saul Bellow, the exemplary Jew is an alie- nated intellectual; in the writings of Bernard Malamud, Jewish wisdom issues forth in stripped-down form from the likes of shopkeeper Morris Bober.30 As our discussion of Henry Roth's Call It Sleep and Philip Roth's "The Conversion of the Jews," makes clear, if rabbis do figure in the fiction of this period, they do so to serve as negative examples, teaching us precisely how not to think, talk, dress, and act in America. Harry Kemelman's Friday the Rabbi Slept Late (1964), the first in a series of twelve mystery novels featuring Rabbi David Small represents a turning point in American Jewish literature. Rabbi Small is the rabbi of a Conservative congrega- tion in the WASP enclave of Barnard's Crossing, Massachusetts, a man whose modem Talmudic training has equipped him with a unique ability both to advocate on behalf of traditional Jewish values and to solve crime mysteries. Like Antin's story, Kemelman's novels serve the function of cultural mediation; in contrast to Antin's story, however, the explanations about Judaism that Rabbi Small offers in the course of solving the given crime are pointed just as much at his 29. Antin, "Malinke's Atonement," 39. 30. See Bernard Malamud, The Assistant (New York: Perennial Classics, 2000). 263</page><page sequence="10">Wendy Zierler assimilated Jewish congregants as to the Gentiles. In performing this dual function of mediation, the rabbi is revealed as a man who is "set off from the Gentile community ... by his Jewish beliefs, and from his own temple membership ... because of his refusal to strive for the accommodation of his religion to the American way of life."31 Rabbi Small's position as a man set apart is underscored in all aspects of his person and character. As his name suggests, he is a man of unimposing physical qualities; in different contexts, his appearance is described as defying congrega- tional expectations. From the very first Rabbi Small novel, this rabbi is celebrated for what he is not: Rabbi Small was probably not what most of his congregants had in mind. Some expected a tall, austere man with a deep resonant voice, an Episcopal bishop sort of a man; Rabbi Small was not tall, and his voice was gentle and mild and matter-of-fact. Some expected a jolly undergraduate sort of young man in gray flannels who would be at home on the golf course or the tennis courts and be at one with the young married set; Rabbi Small was thin and pale and wore eyeglasses, and although in excellent health he was obviously no athlete. Some had an image of the rabbi as dynamic execu- tive, an organizer, a go-getter who would set up committees, cajole or badger the entire congregations into ever more ambitious programs of service; Rabbi Small was rather absent-minded, and had constantly to be reminded of appointments, and had no idea of time or money. Although seemingly amen- able to suggestions, he was also very good at forgetting them, especially if he had no great interest in them in the first place.32 In his book Unheroic Conduct, Daniel Boyarin surveys images of Jewish masculinity from the rabbinic through the modem period and argues that there is "something correct-although seriously misvalued-in the persistent European representation of the Jewish man as a sort of woman."33 Looking at Haggadah illustrations, he notes that "as late as 1823, in a Haggadah published in Vienna, the 'righteous son' is depicted as a Middle eastern scholar wearing a robe and carrying a scroll, while the 'wicked son' is a sort of Roman soldier, with a long sword attached to his belt."34 If Medieval Christian culture lauded the masculine 31.

Over and over again in these novels, Kemelman sets out to defend the rumpled, pale, unworldly, and scholarly Rabbi Small against his would-be detractors and to restore a certain honor to the rabbi as an unmanly Jew. The phenomenal commercial success of the Rabbi Small novels points to the success of Kemelman's efforts.36 As Laurence Roth perceptively notes, "Rabbi Small is a popular cultural example of Boyarin's feminized Jewish male, which means that he both illustrates and contradicts" Boyarin's argument about the way culture has devalued the unmanly Jew.37 Kemelman's description of Rabbi Small persists, with only the slightest variation, throughout the twelve books, suggesting and reiterating a rabbinic ideal that is impervious to the shifting winds of modem Jewish American life, a kind of throwback to the premodern period, when the role of the rabbi was a fixed, unchanging reality. The formulaic nature of each of these novels, all of which feature a crisis in the synagogue inter- woven with a murder mystery that is ultimately solved by the rabbi, underscores the reader's sense of Rabbi Small as an unchanging, "unmanly," and scholarly type. When Rabbi Small finally retires from his congregation to assume an academic post-fulfilling his scholarly ideal-a new rabbi takes over who is less "small," but this is not portrayed as a good development: The new rabbi threatens a peeping Tom by saying that if he finds him on his property again he will throw him over the hedge, a comment that Rabbi Small, Mrs. Small, and the local police all construe as thoroughly unrabbinic: "It seems a strange thing for a rabbi to say even as a joke. Would you ever say something like that, David? I mean, when you were a young man? When you first came here?" "No-o, I don't think so." "I don't think you would have," said Lanigan, "And I don't think Father Tiemey, our pastor, would either. But his curate, Father Bill, might. And do you know why? Because he works out at a gym. He works out with those machines and lifts weights just as your Rabbi Seelig jogs. You get caught up in physical culture, and you're apt to think of physical solutions to problems."38 According to the logic of these novels, then, Rabbi Small's unmanly "smallness" is consistently proven to be a positive attribute. But what are the consequences of 35. Ibid., 52-53. 36. The commonly cited figure for Kemelman's sales is approximately seven million copies.

Critic Ann Pellegrini notes that "within the terms of the homology in which Jew = woman, all Jews are womanly but no women are Jews."39 Pellegrini's postulation is clearly borne out in these novels; if Rabbi Small consistently inhabits his physical culture in a diminutive, womanly way, Mrs. Small, who is presented in all of the novels as short and girlish in appearance, is so undersized as to be ignored entirely as a spiritual or intellectual presence.40 It is important to note, moreover, that on the subject of women's role in Judaism, as in the case of many of the religious issues raised in these novels, Rabbi Small ulti- mately assumes a conservative stance: Though he accepts that Judaism must change with the time, he admits this fact only in limited cases, that is, change writ "small": No, I'm not opposed to change as such. But I'm opposed to unnecessary changes. It seems to me that this particular change is part of the present ferment of the Women's Lib movement, and as it happens in the initial stages of any movement, you get all kinds of exaggerated reactions. A men's club must admit women, or it's sexist. You mustn't say "Chairman," you now have to say "Chairperson." . . . Ridiculous! Look here, we are an institution going back several thousand years. Are we to change because there has been a sudden shift in fashion? Would you have us change the tra- ditional Kol Nidre chant because the musical fashion is rock and roll?41 The same combination of scholarship and conservatism characterizes other rabbis in late-twentieth-century American Jewish literature, from Rabbi Isaac Saunders of Chaim Potok's The Chosen (1967) to Rabbi Elijah Kirshner, the German-born Orthodox rabbi in Allegra Goodman's Kaaterskill Falls (1998), to the portrait of Rabbi Daniel Winter in Joseph Telushkin's three rabbi detective novels.42 PORTRAIT OF THE RABBI AS A YOUNG WOMAN Over the course of the 1980s and 1990s, a number of authors begin to exper- iment with the literary representation of the woman rabbi. In 1983, Rhonda Shapiro-Wieser published a novel called A Place of Light, the last chapters of which depict a Reform woman rabbi who manages, despite the opposition of the ailing senior rabbi and the bitter resentment of his jealous wife, to capture the position of senior rabbi. Four years later, Joseph Teluskhin's The Unorthodox 39.

The title character of Telushkin's mystery novel is Rabbi Myra Wahl, an unrelentingly strident and angry feminist who is universally hated, not only by the male rabbi protagonist of the novel, Rabbi Winter, but also by her own Reform congregation, which desperately wants to fire her. Telushkin decides to have Rabbi Wahl murdered early on in the novel, a plot detail that bespeaks a certain anxiety about the presence of women in the rabbinate, to say the least. Alex J. Goldman's The Rabbi Is a Lady, published the same year, offers a more supportive albeit implausible picture of the widow of a conservative rabbi who, without being ordained or trained in any way, is permanently appointed to her departed husband's pulpit.43 Next comes Erich Segal's Acts of Faith (1992), which tells the story of the son and daughter of the Silczer Rebbe, both of whom become rabbis. The son, Danny Luria, initially turns his back on the hasidic world of his father, whereas the daughter, Deborah Luria, goes the even more errant way of Colleen McCollough's The Thornbirds: She falls in love with a Catholic boy named Timothy who becomes a priest, escapes to a secular kibbutz in Israel, during which time she sees Timothy again and becomes pregnant with his son. Possessed with a desire to study Torah, she leaves the kibbutz and Israel to become ordained a Reform rabbi, though ultimately, she abandons the pulpit as well on the grounds that it does not afford a good lifestyle for a (single) mother. The narrative line of Danny's story runs from his early rejection of the hasidic rabbinate to his later acceptance of his destiny to marry his bashert and become the Silczer Rebbe after all. Deborah's rabbinate, initially an expression of feminist defiance, is literally and figuratively brushed aside by the narrative sweep of Danny's story. Danny finds love and divine vocation by the novel's end; for Deborah, her love of Timothy becomes enough.44 43. Alex J. Goldman, The Rabbi Is a Lady (New York: Hippocrene, 1987). In 1987, Goldman's book was already a bit dated, given that the vote on whether to ordain women in the Conservative movement had already taken place in 1983. In Pamela Nadell's pathbreaking study of the history of women's ordination, she tells the story of a woman named Paula Ackerman, whose husband, Rabbi William Ackerman, the rabbi of a congregation in Meridian, Mississippi, died on November 30, 1950; a week later, the synagogue's board asked Mrs. Ackerman "to carry on the ministry until they could get a rabbi." See Pamela Nadell, Women Who Would Be Rabbis (Boston: Beacon Press, 1998), 120-26. It is possible, therefore, that Goldman based his novel on this real-life story. It is worth noting, however, that Goldman sets his story in suburban Long Island rather than in a place like Meridian, Mississippi. It is unlikely that a congregation located so near the center of American Jewish life and the Jewish Theological Seminary would feel the need to take this step of appointing an (untrained) rebbetzin as rabbi. 44. For another perspective on these novels, as well as discussion of other works, see David J. Zucker, "Rebbetzins and Woman Rabbis: Portrayals in Contemporary American Jewish Fiction," CCAR Journal (Winter-Spring 1995): 1-12; and American Rabbis: Facts and Fiction (Northvale, NJ: Jason Aronson, 1998). Of all the works that I surveyed, Roger Herst's Woman of the Cloth (Rockville, MD: Shengold, 1998), which features both a male and a female rabbi, was the most proble- matic. The novel begins with the mysterious disappearance of the senior Rabbi Seth Greer amid a string of sex scandals. By the end of the novel, the sleuth-like junior Rabbi Gabrielle Lewyn has managed to vindicate her former boss before the entire congregation, on the grounds that Rabbi Greer's various sexual encounters with women congregants were undertaken not for reasons of lust, but for the 267</page><page sequence="14">Wendy Zierler In large part, these novels are of middling literary quality, lacking believable characters and credible incident. Perhaps the most interesting representation of a woman rabbi to surface during this period is a quirky, Malamadesque story by Eileen Pollack, "The Rabbi in the Attic," whose title plays off Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan Gubar's now-classic feminist study of nineteenth-century American women's poetry and fiction.45 Even here, however, Pollack's cartoonish depictions of a crackpot, Old World-style male rabbi (dubbed "Rabbi Or Else") and his hyperbolically leftist female successor, a Reform rabbi whose "voice sounds like fishbones,"46 do little to salvage the rabbinate in either masculine or feminine guise. The next major turning point in the literary representation of the American rabbinate (and the role of women therein) occurred in 2004 with the publication of two beautifully written novels that each offer extended positive and plausible por- trayals of a woman rabbi: Julius Lester's The Autobiography of God and Jonathan Rosen's novel Joy Comes in the Morning. In The Autobiography of God, Julius Lester, a former black civil rights acti- vist and convert to Judaism, whose own identity represents a kind of postmodern multiplicity, plays midrashically with the ideas of revelation and truth and offers a (post)modern challenge to the traditional theology. The countertraditional figure of the woman rabbi helps support and advance this challenge to the authority of and truth of scripture. On one level, Lester's novel, which takes place at a college in the Northeast and includes a murder mystery element, can be seen as an outgrowth of the rabbi mystery novel genre created by Kemelman.47 Like Rabbi Small in the Kemelman novels, Rebecca Nachman, the protagonist of Lester's books, has an uncompromising streak and tendency toward traditional ritual practice. In contrast to Rabbi Small, however, who endures each and every crisis in his synagogue "kabbalistic" purpose of helping these depressed, postmenopausal women achieve an encounter with the Divine. That anyone on earth would buy that argument, let alone a supposedly brilliant, independent minded woman rabbi, is nothing short of incredible. Both Greer and his assistant, Rabbi Gabby, occupy a kind of oversexed presence in this novel. Although the novel promotes the idea of women's place in the rabbinate, it seems to want to detach women rabbis from the feminist movement, placing Gabby and a strong woman lawyer in the position of defending an accused rapist against a female accuser named Elisheva Waller, dubbed in the novel "The Queen of Feminism." This is a woman rabbi who is allowed her place because she drinks with men, sleeps with Jewish and non-Jewish men, fights like a man (in and out of the courtroom), and ultimately deals several major blows to the idea of (feminist) political correctness. For other recent novels in which women rabbis appear, see Anita Diamant, The Good Harbor (2001), Athol Dickson, They Shall See God: A Novel (2002), and Leora Freedman, The Ivory Pomegranate (2002). In Freedman's novel, as in Erich Segal's Acts of Faith, the woman rabbi is given the name Deborah/Devora. 45. See Sandra M.

It is in this postrabbinic phase of her career that we meet our prota- gonist; over the course of the novel, one of her patients at the college is brutally murdered, and by the end of the novel, she possesses the knowledge of the mur- derer's identity. Unlike Rabbi Small, though, Rebecca does not herself solve this mystery. The murderer (a former colleague and admirer) reveals himself to her in the form of a confessional letter, which Rebecca dutifully hands over to the police. The concept of revelation (as opposed to logical deduction) is crucial to this novel, for in addition to the rather conventional murder plot, the novel includes an even more important revelatory strain, including surreal and humorous elements that are evocative of the tales of Rabbi Nachman (hinted by the name Rebecca Nachman) and the short stories of Bernard Malamud, particularly "The Jewbird" and "Angel Levine." Halfway through the book, Rebecca, the daughter of Holocaust survivors, is visited by the angelic spirit of her dead Aunt Devorah (a victim of the Holocaust), who brings with her (at the request of a black angel named Hymie Brown) a text titled "The Autobiography of God," purportedly written by God himself.48 A beautiful and provocative work of modem midrash, the text within the text is a boldly irreverent attempt to rewrite the Genesis creation story, as well as other chapters in Judeo-Christian theology, in light of the persistence of evil as epitomized by the Holocaust. Lester's The Autobiography of God thus becomes not only one of the first books to present an admiring portrait of the rabbi as woman but also one of the first works of Jewish literature to imagine a woman as recipient of revelation: Rebecca touched the box that held God's autobiography. Thomas Aquinas, Augustine, Martin Luther, the Baal Shem Tov, Rabbi Judah the Prince and many others had rejected the opportunity to talk to God face to face. She hadn't. Why? She should have burned the manuscript but she hadn't. Was it because she was a woman? Pandora had opened the box; Eve had eaten the fruit of the tree; and though both myths concluded that the world would be a paradise if these women had minded their business, stasis was not the ideal condition. Maybe women preferred the truth regardless of the consequences.49 A descendant of other truth-seeking women, Rebecca receives this revelation in her dual role as a student of religious texts and as a therapist who must listen with empathy and without judgment to all sorts of personal revelations in order 48. Lester insists, in the name of his woman rabbi, that God must be male. "She never under- stood why some of the women she went to rabbinical school with had insisted that God was female ... Obviously God was male because who except a man who come up with something as ridiculous as vagina, clitoris, uterus, and stick them in the narrow space between a woman's legs where they could not be seen, were hard to find, and then cover them with hair."

In his autobiography, God writes of his attempt to take on flesh to promote goodness and his distress that in response, humans began to sep- arate love/good and evil into different spheres of operation, with a much greater interest all around in evil. In the hope of redressing this imbalance, God takes on flesh as evil but, in the process, gets stuck in the role of evil incarnate. His "Autobiography," as it is written to Rebecca, is a call for "someone to retrieve me from evil."50 Rebe(cca) Nachman thus becomes rabbi-therapist not only of her students-congregants but of God himself. In comparison to Lester's novelistic combination of detective novel and Rabbi Nachman tale, Jonathan Rosen's Joy Comes in the Morning, also written against the shadow of the Holocaust, is thoroughly realistic, insisting that rabbis have access neither to coercive immovable authority nor to revelatory truth. More than that, Rosen's novel makes the postmodern argument that being a rabbi is a kind of identity that is constructed rather than received, that is performed and imitated. But unlike the kinds of sham performance undertaken by the rabbi protagonist in Kandel's Rabbi Burns, the rabbinic performances of identity in Joy Comes in the Morning seem authentically linked with the Jewish past, even as they depict a rabbinate that is very much a part of a changing, postmodern Jewish reality. Rosen's rabbi protagonist is Deborah Green, a name that calls to mind the biblical judge and prophet Deborah in Judges 4-5 and also points to the newness or "greenness" of the very idea of a woman rabbi: SOMEONE WAS DYING. Deborah felt it in her chest. She felt it along her spine. She felt it, though she could not have explained it, in her womb. The feeling stirred her out of half sleep. She opened her eyes. The shades were drawn but a blue light had begun to seep in around the edges. It was 6 a.m. Now would be a good time to hear a voice. She would like to have been called. Deborah! Deborah! But it no longer happened that way, if it ever had.51 Rosen's invocation of womb imagery in this passage verges on a biological essen- tialism that is echoed in other places in the novel. This is a fully embodied woman rabbi whose sexual appeal as she teaches Torah and prays are, perhaps, disturb- ingly overplayed. That said, the womb evocation in this particular passage also strikes a less embodied, more metaphorical note in that it recalls the biblical prophet Deborah's famous poetic celebration of her own "maternal" achievements in protecting the lives of the Israelites in the war against Sisera: "The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until I arose, I arose a mother in Israel" (Judges 5:7). As Tikva Frymer Kensky explains in her commentary on Judges 4-5, [T]he motherhood of this "mother in Israel" goes beyond biology. It describes her [Deborah's] role as a counselor during the days before the war, and it 50. Ibid., 155. 51.

[T]he observation that mothers protect their young against enemies is a universal one. Deborah, the "mother in Israel," protected the people in time of danger.52 In the modem pastoral sense, Deborah Green, though still single and not a biologi- cal mother, represents a new paradigm: the rabbi as mother in Israel, one who looks after her congregants physically, emotionally, and spiritually, feeling their pain as if in her womb. Like the biblical prophet, this Deborah is the mother in Israel who is not limited by the womb, who rises up rather than disappears through her feminine role. Note, however, that if Deborah Green's role recalls that of the biblical Deborah, the concluding lines of the quoted passage make clear the distance between Deborah then and now: "She would like to have been called. Deborah! Deborah! But it no longer happened that way, if it ever had." Though the womb imagery suggests an innate, biologically ordained kind of leadership, Deborah Green avers that leaders are not born or chosen by God but made. To be a rabbi is to construct and perform a rabbinic identity. An acceptance of the unsettled, endlessly constructed nature of rabbinic identity pervades the novel. In part, this notion proceeds from the novelty-the newly constructed historical fact-of women in the rabbinate. In part, it proceeds from the particular kind of liberal rabbinate exemplified by Deborah Green, itself a recent construction or iteration of an ever-changing Reform Judaism. As Deborah reflects, "She resented terms like Orthodox and Reform-they seemed a substitute for the inner state."53 This is a rabbi who defies easy categorization, who keeps kosher and tries to observe minor fasts, who prays daily in tallit or tefillin, who once dated an Orthodox man (Reuben) and now is living with another boyfriend (Lev) whom she met while visiting his father (who had a stroke after trying to commit suicide) in the hospital.54 When Lev first sees Deborah bending over his father in his hospital room, her lips moving but inaudibly (recalling Hannah in I Samuel 1:13), he mistakes her for a nun or a minister administering last rites. By past definitions of Reform Judaism-or any Judaism, for that matter-Deborah's rabbinate is an unexpected, even queer thing. The ghost of I. B. Singer's famous 1962 story "Yentl the Yeshiva Boy" hovers over this novel, further "queering" the idea of rabbinic identity. Unlike Yentl, Deborah need not masquerade as a man to study Talmud with Lev and fall in love. And yet, she remains anxiously cognizant of the way in which her 52.

Or like so many of the women in her graduating class with their close-cropped Yentl-the-yeshiva- boy haircuts and frumpy clothes, you half expected their voices to begin cracking. Deborah disliked being around them and hoped that this aversion was not because her sister, Rachel, was gay."58 Deborah insists-albeit too anxiously-that not all Jewish woman Talmud scholars are transvestites, that Judaism must expand its idea of the scholar beyond the image of the unmanly Jew. Like Deborah, Lev Friedman has his own anxieties about the way in which his identity confounds categories. At the end of the chapter in which Deborah and Lev first get together to study Talmud, a sexually charged scene, Deborah puts "her hands up to his [Lev's] face" and tells him that in his face she sees "[i]ntelligence .... gentleness, You have a great capacity for understanding. A kind of old-world quality. A real Jewish face."59 Lev takes offense to Deborah remarks about his Jewish face and abruptly leaves her apartment: He knew that he did in fact have a throwback face and old-world longings. Just as he knew, despite the winks and nudges of his friends, that when he left Jenny what he wanted, more than the chance to sow wild oats, was some- body he would want to spend his life with. Why that desire should embarrass him was a mystery to him, but it did embarrass him. It seemed ... unmanly. It seemed Jewish.60 The journey of development that both Deborah and Lev undergo in the novel thus involves learning how to accept rather than rail against the crisis of categories that their lives represent. Throughout the novel, we see characters assuming different identities and a persistent challenging of the notion of a fixed, coherent self. The most significant instance occurs when Deborah herself experiences a crisis of faith, both in God and in her relationship with Lev, compel- ling her to flee her own apartment (as Lev did early on in the novel) to seek refuge with her lesbian sister at her home in New Jersey.

While Deborah is away-Lev has no idea where she has gone-he takes a call at Deborah's apartment from a woman who is looking for a rabbi to perform her mother's funeral; somehow, over the course of this conversation, Lev decides to open up Deborah's Gates of Mitzvah. A Guide to the Jewish Life Cycle and quote from it to reassure to the bereaved woman. "You must be a rabbi yourself," the woman says. Before long, Lev is acting the part of rabbi and arranging to perform the funeral. If Singer's "Yentl the Yeshiva Boy" is about a woman who poses as a man in order to study Torah, the scene in this novel in which Lev conducts a funeral puts a new spin on the Yentl plot, offering an instance of a man impersonating a [woman] rabbi: Lev had thought that he might use the little family huddle to try a sort of free- style prayer of the sort Deborah excelled at but his embarrassment was now too great for this ... Deborah had a way of talking that was humble yet somehow commanding. He tried to capture her posture. The crowd stood up at the funeral director's command, a sign of respect to the family. Lev thought for a brief moment, looking out, that he was going to be sick. He was a little weak in the knees, though whether this was from the medication he had taken or nerves or both he could not tell. But he breathed deeply and kept on going.61 To be sure, there is danger in all of this category confusion. One of the subplots in the novel concerns Lev's best friend Neal, a schizophrenic whose identity strad- dles boundaries and splits apart in threatening, lethal ways. In an effort to discern whom he really is, Neal (like Lev) begins to engage in Talmud study and obsess over a particular Talmudic story that appears in B. Hagigah 12b about the four sages who entered the Pardes, a piece of Talmudic aggadah that also plays an important role in Rabbi Milton's Steinberg's classic dramatization of the rabbinic era, the novel As a Driven Leaf (1939). Deborah studies the story with Neal and, from her own faith-seeking point of view, also begins to obsess: "It's a very simple story," said Deborah. "Four men enter what's called Pardes-it might be Paradise, or heaven, or God's presence, or the Garden of Eden. It's murky. Anyway, they're all famous rabbis. It's a kind of spiritual test for them. One of them goes mad. One of them dies. One of them loses faith and becomes a convert. Only rabbi Akiva enters in peace and leaves in peace." "I keep thinking about that story," said Deborah. "because ... I guess I always thought about myself as being Rabbi Akiva. I thought I was chosen somehow, immune to something. Singled out for something. And now I feel like I'm ... not. I'm one of the others.62 61. Ibid., 293-94. 62. Ibid., 268. 273</page><page sequence="20">Wendy Zierler Both Neal and Deborah would like to find their proper category in the (rabbinic) taxonomy outlined in Hagigah 12b. As a person whose brain chemistry continually destabilizes his sense of self, Neal veers to one extreme, arrogating to himself a role or self that is seemingly impervious to change. On a murderous rampage, Neal-evocative of the biblical Yael-kills his mother with a hammer and then almost kills Deborah because of a deranged conviction that he is God: "The answer was so simple. Four entered the orchard and one came out. But one was already there. God was there! A fifth presence in the orchard, a fifth way he had never realized before. You didn't enter because you were already there; you didn't leave because you were everywhere."63 If Neal psychotically embraces the monolithic option of being God, Deborah's discussion of this text with Dawn and with her sister Rachel yields a queer reading of Hagigah 12b: "Don't you think," Rachel said, "you should think of yourself as being all those characters in that story? Do you have to be the one guy that leaves in peace? Can't you be all of them-not to mention none of the them?" It was good advice, she supposed, Nothing was fixed."64 This line, perhaps more than any other line quoted thus far, best encapsulates my subject. In the (post)modem period, there is indeed nothing "fixed" about the rab- binate. Our discussion began with the ways in which modem Jews attempt to fix Judaism in general, and the rabbinate in particular, to make it conform to a chan- ging modem reality. The American Jewish literary record shows that, so far, the rabbinate has not yet has been fixed, neither in the sense of being "repaired" nor in the sense of being placed or affixed in a permanent (pulpit) position. At the end of Rosen's Joy Comes in the Morning, Deborah Green loses her rabbinic job for a variety of reasons-among them, a board member's discovery that she is living with a man who impersonated her and performed a funeral in her absence. Clearly, this is a community that is still not quite comfortable with the female rabbis it has generated and certainly not with the gender confusion that arises when women rabbis become role models for men. Deborah Green's postmodem rabbinate as seen in this novel-in contradistinction to the traditional, pompous, and uninspiring model of leadership exemplified by the senior rabbi who presides over her dismissal-is very much a work in progress, an identity trying on differ- ent guises and imitating or inventing different forms in an effort to arrive at a kind of faith and service that is both generative, sincere, and "real." In writing about the phenomenon of drag, theorist Judith Butler observes that, "[i]n imitating gender, drag implicitly reveals the imitative structure of gender itself-as well as its con- tingency."65 Our discussion fittingly culminates, then, with a passage in which 63.

"everything I did was an impersonation. I was imi- tating you. I was reading from the manual. But somehow they took it as real. And that made it real for me. Do you know what I mean?" "I know exactly what you mean," said Deborah. "All rabbis are impersonators." "But does that make them false?" "No," Deborah conceded. "That's how tradition works, I suppose. As long as you don't lose sight of the thing that inspired tradition in the first place."66 Wendy Zierler Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion New York, New York 66.
