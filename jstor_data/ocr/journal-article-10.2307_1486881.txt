According to Marc A. Weiner, "Nineteenth-century audiences were sensitive and receptive to the racist implications of Wagner's musical material for the Nibelungs" (p. 140). And what, exactly, were there audiences sensitive to? Weiner explains, "The 'hissing and gurgling' of Jewish speech that Wagner emphasizes in 'Das Judentum in der Musik' is discernible in the violent interlocution of the Nibelungs in large part because much of their exchange is set to a staccato and dissonant music in the upper half of their vocal registers" (ibid.). Weiner is careful to specify "nineteenth-century audiences." Without an extramusical context, music can have no meaning other than an aesthetic 1. See, in particular, his Jewish Social Ethics (New York, 1992), pp. 187-205.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 133 one. This is paradoxical, since music has enormous emotional power. Indeed, Ayatollah Khomeini banned Western music from Iranian radio stations, and Plato's Republic would not have tolerated the manufacture of the flute or other instruments "capable of modulation into all the modes" (Book III: 398-400). As for Wagner himself, it would have been wrong not to have an extramusical context. Wagner felt that separate genres, such as architecture, music, and poetry, were the result of a breakdown of the original Greek (and Indo-European) world that supposedly existed before the rise of the individualism so characteristic of modem society, a world he hated. Wagner called his operas "music dramas" because he wanted to recreate in Germany the organic community that had supposedly existed before Rome and Chris- tianity. "According to Wagner, in classical antiquity the arts were not divided into separate genres as we know them today but were merged into one, organically whole, single aesthetic unity, and that unity mirrored the bonds holding together the community that beheld it" (p. 42). Needless to say, the community that Wagner was trying to recreate through his music dramas was a world without Jews. Wagner was open about his views. Among the many quotations Weiner cites from Wagner's essay "Das Judentum in der Musik" is the following: "In everyday life the Jew strikes us first of all by his external appearance, which, no matter what European nationality we belong to, has something unpleasantly foreign to this nationality: we desire instinctively to have nothing to do with/nothing in common with a person who looks like that" (p. 57). An antisemite would logically want to defame Jews. The creator of a post-Jewish, pure, Germanic art, on the other hand, cannot have any Jews-discordant, foreign elements-in his artistic creations. Perhaps Wagner was unaware of this paradox. Or perhaps he was quite aware and tried to express his hatred for Jews by projecting their traits onto figures who weren't Jewish--a way of eating his cake (or his antisemitism) and having it too. Both in the world of opera and in the real world, antisemitism can survive without the presence of Jews. Wagner's works looked forward "to the establishment of a unified, homogeneous society, to the rebirth of the Greek spirit in a future Germany rid of the foreign element of the Jew" (p. 53); nevertheless, he included the antisemitic music that Weiner describes, the music that accompanies such characters as the Nibelungs in the Ring, Beckmesser in Die Meistersinger, and Kundry in Parsifal. Indeed, except for Kundry, "who mocked Christ and is punished with the fate of the Wandering Jew (as Wagner himself characterized</page><page sequence="3">134 BOOK REVIEWS her)" (p. 239), these figures could not possibly have been Jewish. Weiner himself makes this clear: "an impossibility, given Beckmesser's social position within sixteenth-century Nuremberg and the timeless, mythic setting of the Ring" (p. 327). The case of Beckmesser is particularly relevant here. This Wagnerian villain was modeled on the critic Eduard Hanslick. According to Robert W. Gutman,' "[Hanslick] was a Jew, and Wagner took special pains to expose the culprit .... Apparently, Hanslick's mother descended from a prosperous Jewish merchant family, and he was not particularly desirous of having the fact known." Hanslick was invited to the home of a man named Dr. Standhartner "to hear Wagner recite the Meistersinger poem (November 23, 1862). At this time the narrow-minded character now known to the world as Beckmesser appeared in Wagner's manuscript under the name of Hanslich. Wagner had maliciously trapped the critic in a barbarously contrived situation."2 Weiner, curiously, does not mention this incident, although he cites Gutman in his book. A modem audience, to be sure, does not think that Beckmesser or the Nibelungs "look Jewish." On the the hand, twentieth-century opera lovers do often think of Siegfried and sometimes of Parsifal as embodiments of Wagnerian racial ideals. Although Wagner's antisemitism is implicit in his racism, his music dramas do not succeed as antisemitic works. There is a certain logic to the fact that Wagner's Germans come across as Germans to us, while his characters with Jewish traits, who could not have been Jews in the times and places where the action occurs, do not today come across as Jews. Even when the operas were first written, even among audiences who understood Wagner's musical code, the absence of Jews should have rendered the music dramas ineffective as antisemitic propaganda. We may legitimately ask, however, whether this message was in the original at all. Wagner may well have intended his operas to be antisemitic, but he failed. In an important essay, M. K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley state: "Judging a poem is like judging a pudding or a machine. One demands that it work. It is only because an artifact works that we may infer the intention of the artificer."3 1. R. W.

If Weiner agreed, perhaps he would not have written Richard Wagner and the Anti-Semitic Imagina- tion. But Weiner agrees that Wagner's intentions are no longer relevant to contemporary music lovers. Let me give him the last word: "Personally, I refuse to receive Wagner's works as he would have had them received, and the fact that our culture is not Wagner's may constitute our redemption (to use one of his favorite terms) from the Wagnerian agenda and may allow us to experience his breathtakingly beautiful and stirring musical-dramatic accomplishments as works that can be enjoyed despite their initial, intended message of racial exclusion" (p. 29).
