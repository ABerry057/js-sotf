Cooper INTEREST IN LOST TRIBES: MEDIA AND GENRES I met Simcha Jacobovici in 1998 while doing my dissertation research in Uzbekistan. Long-haired, fair-skinned, and dressed in American garb, he was clearly an outsider like myself, and we introduced ourselves. I told him I was a cultural anthro- pologist doing fieldwork among the Bukharan Jews. He told me that he was a film- maker collecting footage for a documentary about the ten lost tribes. I had heard the theory that the Bukharan Jews were among the lost Israelite tribes, but I considered it far-fetched and had trouble taking Simcha's enthusiasm about the possibility seriously. I found out later, however, that others were taking him quite seriously. Simcha Jacobovici, it turns out, is an Emmy Award-winning filmmaker who had come to Bukhara together with a film crew, carrying state-of-the art equipment and backed by $1.4 million from the Canadian Broadcast Company and A&amp;E Television Networks to fund the documentation of his quest for the lost tribes. Indeed, there has been quite a stir over the past several years surrounding the possibility that some of the lost tribes have been located-not only in Bukhara but also in India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Africa, and Japan. Jacobovici's film, in fact, has become part of a growing genre of works dedicated to the documentation of ten-tribe travel-journeys in search of the lost Israelites. In addition to Quest for the Ten Tribes, which aired in 1999, a NOVA special titled "The Lost Tribes of Israel" aired on PBS in 2000.1 Popular Jewish magazines and newspapers have given attention to such travel adventures in the past few years in articles such as "Lost Tribes of Israel," published in Midstream;2 "Go Tell It to the Sons of Menashe," published in the Jerusalem Post;3 and "Our Brethren the Taliban," published in the Jerusalem Report.4 More recently, Israeli American 1.

Cooper author Hillel Halkin published Across the Sabbath River.- In Search of a Lost Tribe of Israel, which has received much attention, having been reviewed in several newspapers and magazines including the New York Times, Commentary, and the Forward.5 All this fanfare and fascination with the fate of the lost Israelite tribes is, of course, not new. Some 2,700 years ago, the Assyrians conquered northern Israel and carried off the ten tribes who inhabited that land.6 The prophets foresaw their return. But at least as far back as Mishnaic times, questions surrounding their fate have been debated. Over the centuries, a continued interest in the lost tribes has been framed in terms of four literary genres: travelers' reports, critical speculation, fictional accounts, and comprehensive surveys. 1. Travelers' reports: Eldad the Danite was the first recorded ten-tribe traveler. During the ninth century, he was said to have set out from his home somewhere in East Africa. Upon his arrival in North Africa, he enchanted the local Jewish communities with stories about his homeland, which he claimed was inhabited by his tribe, Dan, as well as by the tribes of Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. Since the time of Eldad, a number of figures have gained renown on account of their ten-tribe travel, among them the twelfth-century Benjamin of Tudela, thirteenth-century Abraham Abulafia, sixteenth- century David Reubeni, seventeenth-century Antonio Montezionos, and nineteenth-century travelers Israel Benjamin (also called Benjamin II) and David d'Beth Hillel. Travelers who have joined their ranks more recently include those mentioned previously (Simcha Jacobovici, Shalva Weil, and Hillel Halkin), as well as Rabbi Eliyahu Avichail and anthropologist Tudor Parfitt. 2. Critical speculation: Over the centuries, critics have analyzed the auth- enticity and reliability of these travelers' reports, creating their own genre of ten-tribe writing. Most notable are the nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century critical editions of the Eldad manuscripts,7 which 5. Hillel Halkin, Across the Sabbath River: In Search of a Lost Tribe of Israel (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2002), is a chronicle of the author's search to determine whether the people of Mizoram and Manipur of northeast India are indeed lost tribesmen. Reviews include Judith Shulevitz, "Funny You Don't Look Jewish," New York Times Book Review, October 20, 2002; Jon D. Levenson, "Your Children Shall Return," Commentary, September 2002, 63-64; and Alana Newhouse, "Members of the Lost Tribe?" Forward, February 8, 2002. 6. In her article "At the Nexus of History and Memory: The Ten Lost Tribes," AJS Review 29, no. 2 (2005), 207-36, Pamela Barmash explains that the Assyrians did not deport all of the northerners. Many were not exiled and remained in their homeland, and many others moved south to live among their compatriots in Judah. 7.

Neubauer, "Where Are the Ten Tribes: Eldad the Danite," Jewish Quarterly Review 1 (1889): 95-114. 96</page><page sequence="3">Conceptualizing Diaspora addressed the question of whether there really was an Eldad the Danite who recorded notes on the lost tribes, or whether the text was made up much later and attributed to a ninth-century man by the name of Eldad. Critics also question the veracity of Eldad's travel journal. Even if, for example, there was an Eldad, are the details of his story true? Or might he have fabricated them, either in an act of deceit, as some have suggested, or simply because he was weary and confused from his travels, as others have suggested? Finally, critics question the signifi- cance of the travelers' evidence. Even if, for example, all of the details of Eldad's story are true, do they prove that the people whom he writes about are really lost tribesmen? 3. Fictional accounts: Perhaps the most well known of these is Mendele Mokher Seforim's Travels of Benjamin the III. Other fictional accounts include those that fall into the category of "lost race fiction," a type of adventure tale that emerged in late nineteenth-century American litera- ture. More recently, Annette Henkin Landau published "Lost Tribes," a short story about the Jews of China, in the Spring 2002 issue of Moment magazine. Finally, it should be noted that in many cases, the distinction between factual and fictional ten-tribe travel is quite blurry.9 4. Comprehensive surveys: These works consist of annotated bibliogra- phies and collections of source materials. Simcha Shtull-Trauring's Letters from Beyond the Sambatyon: The Myth of the Lost Tribes, for example, is a slim collection of first- through seventeenth-century sources written by "travelers, scholars and theologians," all of which address the lost tribes. Likewise, a series of articles published by A. Neubauer in the Jewish Quarterly Review (1889) reviews the story of the lost tribes as it is presented in biblical, Talmudic, and midrashic literature, as well as in letters and travel diaries. Among this wide variety of works, one genre is noticeably absent: There are few meta-analyses that address the mythic quality of the lost tribe story. Although a number of scholars have offered reasons why the story has remained compelling over so many centuries, these explanations have generally been given as asides rather than as comprehensive discussions.10 One notable exception is Tudor 8. For a list of these works, refer to Stuart Teitler, "In Search of Zion: Annotated Bibliography of Lost Tribes in Utopia," in America as Utopia, ed. Kenneth Roemer (New York: B. Franklin, 1981). 9. For example, Gelilot Erez Yisrael, written by Gershon ben Eliezer Halevi Yiddels of Prague, who in 1624 supposedly traveled to the Holy Land and then to the land where the ten tribes dwell. On his fantastic journey, he reports having encountered strange creatures, including three-eyed beasts and headless men.

Cooper Parfitt's recently published comprehensive work The Lost Tribes of Israel: The History ofa Myth." Parfitt's analysis, however, like that of the others, is informed by a European, Christian perspective and does not address what the story may signify for the Jews. This paper is designed to fill in this gap in the literature. It is an effort to understand why the story of the ten tribes has captured the Jewish popular imagin- ation for so many centuries. It is different from most works that deal with ten-tribe travel in that it does not address the authenticity of the accounts. It does not attempt to get at the "truth" of the stories that travelers have told-that is, whether their methodologies are sound, whether their data analyses make sense, or whether their conclusions are far-fetched or reasonable. Instead, it is an exploration of the meaning and significance of this grand narrative. The present analysis focuses on permutations of the tale told by adventurers who have traveled to search out the lost tribes throughout the ages. Although there are only a handful of recorded cases of ten-tribe travel, the records that these travelers left behind have been (and continue to be) printed, reprinted, and popu- larly circulated, transmitting the myth across time and space. An analysis of these travelers' stories reveals that they fall into two basic categories: on one hand, tales of the lost tribes on the brink of a messianic homecoming and reunion with their Jewish brethren and, on the other hand, utopian stories of tribesmen living in scattered, sovereign communities (or kingdoms). Which of these two paradigms a traveler chooses to invoke as a frame for his12 journey depends on several factors, including the historical and cultural context of his travel as well as on his own personal sensibilities. A comparative analysis that takes these factors into account would be an interesting and important exercise, but one that is beyond the scope of this paper. Here, I isolate the essential features of the myth-as it has been told across time and space-and identify two paradigmatic versions of it. These versions provide two views of diaspora, both of which are contained within the Jewish imagination. I will conclude with a discus- sion of the complex relationship between these paradigms by showing that each contains whispers of the other. THEORETICAL ORIENTATION Published in the inaugural volume of the journal Diaspora, William Safran's article "Diasporas in Modem Societies" notes that the term "diaspora" has become an increasingly popular analytical category as the world has undergone massive changes linked to globalization and transnationalism.'3 Rather than celebrating the expansion of the term's definition, as other scholars do, Safran claims that its value has been denigrated, and he calls for a return to past understandings of 11. Tudor Parfitt, The Lost Tribes of Israel: The History of a Myth (London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2002). 12. Aside from contemporary anthropologist Shalva Weil, there is no record of any other women ten-tribe travelers. 13. Safran, "Diasporas in Modern Societies: Myths of Homeland and Return," Diaspora 1, no.1 (Spring 1991), 83-99. 98</page><page sequence="5">Conceptualizing Diaspora what "diaspora" is all about. The term, Safran argues, was once written with a capital D to refer specifically to the Jews' exile "from their historic homeland and their dispersion throughout many lands." Labeling this case as the "ideal type," he goes on to extract its most salient features: the primacy of the homeland in days gone by, the loss of it, the memory of it, and the longing to return to it. In one of the most widely cited works on the topic of diaspora, James Clifford responds to Safran's retro definition with a criticism, arguing that the term should not be restricted to "exclusivist paradigms" that are centered around the notion of homeland and a teleology of return. "A shared ongoing history of displacement, suffering, adaptation, or resistance," Clifford writes, is just as salient a feature of the diaspora condition-if not more so-than a shared longing for return to a common home. Drawing on the five-volume work of historian S. D. Goitein, Mediterranean Society, Clifford argues that the Jews of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East composed a common "society" not because of their shared "attachments to a lost homeland" but rather because their social universe was "linked through cultural forms, kinship relations, business circuits, and travel."14 What joins the Jews, in other words, are lateral ties that need not cross through a single central locale. Clifford also notes that Jews of the Mediterranean world formed attachments to the cities and regions in which they lived. Such local connections "cast doubt," he concludes, on any definition-most notably Safran's-"that would 'center' the Jewish diaspora in a single land." The positions forwarded by Clifford and Safran represent two poles of the current academic debate surrounding the nature of the Jewish diaspora: on one hand, the notion that dispersion is a legitimate, defining feature of the Jewish con- dition, as is the celebration of the many forms of Jewish life around the globe, and on the other hand, the notion that the collective memory of the lost homeland and the longing to return to it are the essential features of the Jewish condition. This debate, of course, is not new. It was articulated in the late nineteenth century with the advent of modem Zionism. So, too, it came to the fore a century before that, when Jews in western Europe were faced with the question of whether their loyalties lay with the newly emerging nation-states they inhabited or with Zion, the object of their prayers. But long before the modem era, Jewish understandings of their diaspora condition were the subject of discussion and debate. This debate, I believe, has been generated by the discomfort of living with two contradictions, both inherent in the diaspora condition: that of being at home in the diaspora while being acutely aware that one is not in the homeland, and that of struggling to maintain a normative, centralized religion while recognizing that authority is inevitably dispersed when there is no longer an agreed-upon center. It is this conflict-ridden existence that brings us to the story of the lost tribes. In this paper, I argue that the centuries-old story of the lost Israelite tribes is a powerful vehicle for Jews to make sense of these contradictions. As such, it will not be treated here as literal history. Rather, it will be read on a symbolic level, as a 14.

Cooper story that reveals the complexity of Jewish conceptions of dispersal, home, authority, and peoplehood. One of the difficulties involved in this task lies in the fact that the story of the lost tribes has never been canonized. There are many versions of it, and each contains differing-often contradictory-elements. Such contradictions are not particular to the myth of the lost tribes. In fact, anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss, who collected and analyzed hundreds of versions of Native American myths, took note of the many contradictory elements among them. Drawing attention to these elements, he argued that they illuminate key areas of social and psychic tension. In the spirit of Levi-Strauss, the present analysis characterizes the story of the lost tribes as a "mythic" expression in which the contradictory elements encompass the tensions of the Jewish diaspora experience. RUPTURE OF THE JEWISH WORLD In the popular imagination, the period of King David's and King Solomon's reign is conceived of as a utopian era. Under a united monarchy, the Jews lived in their own land, divided into tribal units but joined within a single kingdom. According to the Bible, each tribe had its own distinct territory, delineated by the Word of God (Joshua 13-21). So, too, each had particular attributes and assigned destinies (Genesis 49; Deuteronomy 33). Each tribe was represented before God by the high priest, who wore a breastplate inlaid with twelve stones, each stone a different color, representing the uniqueness of each particular tribe (Exodus 28). In short, each tribal group had its own identity, which was not under- stood to be a cultural construction but a God-given reality. Together, they formed a single whole, united through kinship, cult, and common history. When King Solomon died, the people of Israel split into two factions. The tribes of Judah and Benjamin formed the Southern Kingdom, and the remaining ten tribes formed the Northern Kingdom. This division of the people into two kingdoms preceded the ultimate split, which would occur two centuries later, when the Assyrians invaded the Land of Israel, conquered the Northern Kingdom, and exiled its people. Jewish dispersion, of course, did not conclude there. The Babylonian- imposed exile of 586 BCE and the Roman-imposed exile of 70 CE brought an end to Jewish national sovereignty and contributed to the scattering of the Jewish people. These latter exiles, however, gave birth to major centers of Jewish religious and political authority, which were established in the diaspora to maintain vital links between the widely scattered people. What became of the tribes of the Northern Kingdom, on the other hand, has long been the subject of debate. Where were they displaced? Have they totally assimilated, or have they maintained some features of Jewish identity and practice? Although these ques- tions are asked about the ten tribes, I believe they can also be read as psychological projections related to very real fears about the consequences of exile and dispersion for Judaism and for the Jewish people as a whole. Throughout their 2,000-year-long diaspora history, Jewish political and religious leaders have remained vigilant in their efforts to maintain a normative 100</page><page sequence="7">Conceptualizing Diaspora religion and a unified Jewish people, consciously struggling to rein in the centrifu- gal forces of dispersion. The lost tribes represent the possibility of what can happen when this vigilance is not maintained or when efforts fail. What happens, for example, when the authority of a religious center is challenged by rival institutions? Is there room for multiple centers of authority and for religious variety and difference? What qualifies the practices of one Jewish community as normative and another as deviant? Or one group as authentically Jewish and another not? The stories told by ten-tribe travelers provide a framework for nego- tiating large questions such as these-questions that are related to the maintenance of a unitary Jewish people and a normative religion in the diaspora context. UTOPIAN RETURN Behold, I will take the children of srael from among the nations, whither they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land; And I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel, and one king shall be king to them all... (Ezekiel 37:21-22). Simcha Jacobovici: Filmmaker on a "Quest for the Lost Tribes" We begin our exploration of the theme of utopian return by turning to Simcha Jacobovici's Quest for the Lost Tribes. Although this film can hardly be considered authoritative, it does present a story that is worth retelling here, both because it has contemporary popular appeal and because it highlights the conti- nued relevance of an age-old yearning for the reunion of Israel in the Holy Land. The film tells the story of Jacobovici's journey across the globe to find the lost tribes. He begins in Ethiopia, where he locates the tribe of Dan. He then moves to Manipur, India (near the Burmese border), showing footage of local people lighting Shabbat candles, wearing kippot, praying in a synagogue, and singing modem Jewish songs. He identifies these people as descendents of the tribe of Menashe. In Uzbekistan, Jacobovici finds archeological and historical evidence that convinces him that the local Jewish community descended from the tribes of Issachar and Naphtali. He then returns to India, where he uncovers information indicating that the local Jews are descendents of the tribe of Zevulun. Finally, he travels to Afghanistan and Pakistan, where he becomes convinced that the similarity between Israelite tribal names and local tribal names is proof that the 15 million Pathans are Israelites from the lost tribes of Reuven, Gad, Ephraim, and Shimon. In addition to locating the lost tribes, Jacobovici's journey is also about finding out what these tribesmen are up to. He learns that they are not passively waiting in their homelands to be "discovered" by their fellow Jews. Rather, they are in the process of an active migration "home" to Israel. He shows, for example, footage from interviews conducted among the people of Menashe in Manipur, where individuals express their longing to move to Israel. Switching scenes, he focuses on a number of them who have moved to Israel: one dressed in an army uniform, a few working on a kibbutz, and others praying at the Western Wall. 101</page><page sequence="8">Alanna E. Cooper The homeward-bound Menashe are not alone, Jacobovici tells his viewers. Through his travels and his research, he has learned that the tribe of Dan (from Ethiopia), the tribes of Issachar and Naphtali (from Uzbekistan), and the tribe of Zevulun (from India) are all returning home. With wide-eyed exuberance, Jacobovici describes the moment when he came to the dramatic realization that he was witnessing the ingathering of the exiles, which Ezekiel had prophesized: "So maybe it was happening. Maybe the end of time was unfolding." Jacobovici proposes that we are living at a historical moment in Jewish history: the moment of the prophesied reunion of the Jewish people in their home- land. In this sense, his film is more than just a travel documentary. It is also docu- mentation of his own personal spiritual journey, in which he connects to his lost brethren the world over and bears witness to the dawn of the messianic era. It is no wonder that Jacobovici claims to have had a spiritual reawakening on this trip and to have become more religious upon his return.15 Significant, too, is the role that Jacobovici himself subtly claims to play in the hastening of this prophesied return. He explains, "According to the prophecy, the countdown to the apocalypse and final redemption begins when the tribes are found one by one." Jacobovici's travels are not just travels but steps on the road to national redemption. Eliyahu Avichail: Rabbinic Traveler and Ingatherer Through the making of his film, Jacobovici aimed to play a small part in trying to help the redemptive process along. Rabbi Eliyahu Avichail, on the other hand, has taken an active, aggressive role in attempting to bring the Messiah through his work with those whom he considers "lost tribesmen." Avichail is considered the leading ten-tribe traveler alive today, on three accounts: the far-reaching extent of his travels; the fact that he has provided entree for many contemporary travelers who have journeyed to search out the lost tribes (including Jacobovici and Halkin); and the fact that his work has had concrete, practical consequences. In his book Shivtei Yisrael (1987), Avichail explains that only God can orchestrate the messianic ingathering of the exiles. Yet drawing on mystical texts, which teach that everything we human beings do here on earth is metaphysically linked to God's actions, he insists that our work toward bringing the Messiah will hasten God's intervention in the matter.16 Thus, he claims that it is each Jew's responsibility to search for the lost tribes and to help them return to the Holy Land. Avichail has put these ideals into practical action. During the 1970s he founded Amishav ("My nation shall return"), an organization dedicated to locating Israel's lost tribes and encouraging and helping them to move to Israel. Carrying out his mission, he has traveled to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Japan, and India in an effort to follow up on a variety of leads that he believes point to connections between ancient Israel and the peoples of these areas. 15.

As the spiritual father of this group, he has traveled to India several times to provide them with religious instruction, teaching them to pray and to observe the laws of kashrut, Shabbat, and family purity. In addition, he has provided them with books, prayer shawls, and Torah scrolls. But more than that, he has worked to formally convert many of them to Judaism. This conversion process has legitimized their Jewish status in the eyes of the Israeli government's rabbinic auth- orities, which has, in turn, facilitated the immigration of some 800 of them to Israel. 18 These numbers are trivial next to Ezekiel's prophecy, which foresaw a massive, complete ingathering of "the children of Israel from among the nations, whither they are gone." Nevertheless, they are an indication of Avichail's seriousness of purpose. His travels are not motivated by the allure of adventure or a desire to see the world. Nor is he wandering, unsure of his destination or purpose. Avichail travels with a mission and a clear sense of direction. He is fully oriented at all times-not to the compass north-but toward the Holy Land. David Reubeni's Mission to Reunite the Kingdom of Joseph and Judah Jacobovici's and Avichail's recent endeavors have their roots in a long- standing tradition that links the ingathering of the lost tribes and the dawn of the messianic era. This tradition gained widespread popularity in sixteenth- century Portugal, where the charismatic David Reubeni-described by a contemporary as "dark, short, lean.... great of spirit, stouthearted and fear- less"19--appeared at the court of King John III. Like Avichail and Jacobovici, Reubeni worked toward reuniting the lost tribes and their Jewish brethren in the Holy Land. However, rather than traveling east to seek out the tribes, Reubeni claimed that he himself was from the land of the lost tribes and traveled west to represent his people before the rulers of Europe. The story of his travel adventures is preserved in a lengthy travelogue written in the first person.20 Reubeni begins his story by explaining who he is: "I am David, the son of King Solomon ... and my brother is King Joseph, who sits on the throne of his 17. These are the same Menashe in Mizoram and Manipur who are featured in Jacobovici's film. They are also the subject of Hillel Halkin's Across the Sabbath River. 18. See Abigail Radoszkowicz, "Bnei Menashe Aliya Halted by Poraz," Jerusalem Post, July 7, 2003. More recently, as a result of Avichail's efforts, Israel's Sephardic chief rabbi, Shlomo Amar, has extended formal recognition to the Bnei Menashe as "descendants of Israel." It is expected that the majority of the community of 6,000 people will immigrate to Israel in the near future. See BBC News, April 1, 2005, http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4400957.stm. 19. See Harris Lenowitz, The Jewish Messiahs: From the Galilee to Crown Heights (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), 103. 20. Based on a copy of the original manuscript, Lenowitz (ibid.) contends there is "sufficient evidence" to prove that the travelogue was written in Reubeni's time and, in all likelihood, by Reubeni himself (105). Whether the protagonist of the travelogue was, in fact, the author himself does not prove (or disprove) the veracity of the information contained in the document. 103</page><page sequence="10">Alanna E. Cooper kingdom in the wilderness of Habor.... and rules over thirty myriads of the tribe of Gad and of the tribe of Reubeni and of the half-tribe of Manasseh."21 After this brief introduction, Reubeni launches into a fantastic description of his trip "through deserts and forests and fields,"22 from his homeland in Habor23 to Egypt. He tells of the portable wooden huts in which he slept, the "great sickness he endured," the elephant- and leopard-eating people he encountered, and the lion cubs he received as a gift.24 After close to two years of travel, our narrator reached Palestine. The next part of his journal tells of his brief sojourn there. It focuses, in particular, on his experiences at the Temple Mount, where he received a miracu- lous sign indicating that the time had come for him to venture to Europe. The rest of his journal, which makes up the largest portion of the text, tells of his travels in Europe.25 When he arrived in Italy, Reubeni finally revealed the purpose of his long and difficult voyage: to save the Jews from their condition of exile. The first step in his plan was to mobilize support from the heads of state in Christian Europe. To this end, he attempted to enlist Pope Clement VII in an effort to "make peace between the Emperor and the French King."26 By orchestrating an alliance between these two rulers, Reubeni hoped to strengthen their position against the Turks, lead them into war, and liberate the Holy Land from Muslim control. As general of the Haborite army, he would supply the troops if the Western powers would agree to provide them with arms. In return for their service, Reubeni hoped that Jerusalem, once captured, would be secure in Jewish hands. The pope refused the assistance Reubeni requested. He did, however, agree to pay for Reubeni's expenses during his stay in Rome and provide him with a 21. The manuscript was written Hebrew. Unless otherwise noted, excerpts are taken from the English translation provided by Elkan Adler in his book Jewish Travellers (New York: Block Publish- ing Company, 1931). The most authoritative Hebrew printed version of the text appears in Aaron Zeev Aescoly's Sippur David HaReuveni (The Story of David Hereuveni), which was first published in 1940 and reprinted in 1993 in Jerusalem. Other Hebrew editions can be found in Adolf Neubauer, Medieval Jewish Chronicles (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1887); Judah David Eisenstein, Ozar Massaoth (New York: The Author, 1926); and Eduard Biberfeld; Nesi'at David ha-Reuveni (Berlin: Itskowski, 1892). 22. Adler, Jewish Travellers, 252. 23. According to 2 Kings 18:11, Habor is one of the locales to which the tribes were carried away: "And the king of Assyria carried Israel away unto Assyria, and put them in Halah, and in Habor, on the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes." The contemporary coordinates of these places have long been open to speculation. 24. Adler, Jewish Travellers, 251-58. 25. Miriam Eliav-Feldon points out that there is "no documentary corroboration for his travels prior to his arrival in Europe." However, the information Reubeni records about his travels in Europe is "basically confirmed in other accounts." See Eliav-Feldon, "Invented Identities: Credulity in the Age of Prophecy and Exploration," Journal of Early Modern History 3, no. 3 (1999), 211. Indeed, Aescoly's Sippur David ha-Reuveni contains a collection of documents authored both by Jewish and non-Jewish contemporaries of Reubeni that offers much corroborating evidence for the information contained in the travelogue. 26.

With the pope's support, Reubeni set sail for Portugal, where he entered the court of King John III with fifteen horses and fifty men, "each one with a sword upon his thigh."27 Duly impressed, the king agreed to provide Reubeni with "large and small firearms" and "four mills in ships." However, just as quickly as he had won the king over, Reubeni fell out of favor. Word had gotten out that he was causing a flurry of excitement among Portugal's population of crypto-Jews, who believed the army general from Habor had come to liberate them. Sensing a threat to his authority, the king ordered Reubeni to leave his realm. This is where Reubeni's diary ends, and it is not clear what ever became of him.28 One thing, though, is certain: David Reubeni failed in his mission to seize the Holy Land from the Turks and turn it over to Jewish hands. Regardless of this failure, Reubeni's steadfast persistence in attempting to fulfill his mission-and the support he gathered along the way-is testimony to the powerful message of hope expressed in Ezekiel's messianic prophecy of reunion between the Jews and their long-lost Israelite tribesmen.29 As such, Reubeni's diary offers an important commentary on the Jewish diaspora condition. One way to analyze this commentary is to take note of the information that is missing from the diary. Although Reubeni makes numerous mentions of the fact that he is from the land of the ten tribes in the wilderness of Habor, he never describes the place or the people who inhabit the area. He is utterly silent about their language, their economy, their customs, their religious practices, their social institutions, and their relationships with their neighbors. It is also significant that Reubeni provides extensive information about the Jews he meets along his travels, many of whom welcomed him, facilitated his travels, and even funded parts of his trip. Yet the reader is provided with no ethnographic information about the communities to which they belong. Who were their religious leaders? What did their synagogues and houses of study look like? What was the nature of their community life and family life? In short, Reubeni had no interest in describing life in the diaspora-neither among the lost tribesmen nor among the Jews whom he encountered in Egypt, Palestine, and Europe. Like Avichail and Jacobovici, he does not celebrate Jewish life in its many places of dispersion. He is, instead, completely focused on returning the scattered populations home. Consistent with this approach is the fact that Reubeni does not use his meet- ings with Pope Clement VII or King John III to request amelioration of the Jewish condition in Europe. So, too, when the conversos in Beja approach him "fearful and weeping," he gives them no guidance regarding how they might organize 27. Ibid., 289. 28. Evidence suggests that Reubeni continued to seek support for his plan even after he was banished from Portugal and suffered shipwreck, arrest, and imprisonment in Spain. See Eliav- Feldon, "Invented Identities," 211. 29. "Thus said the Lord God: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them unto him together with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand" (Ezekiel 37:19). 105</page><page sequence="12">Alanna E. Cooper themselves or approach their rulers in an effort to improve their lot. In this post- expulsion era, when the Jewish sense of exile is palpable, as is the fear of living under the oppression of the Inquisition, Reubeni sees no hope for a Jewish future outside the homeland. He responds to the conversos accordingly, with a vision of the Jews' return to sovereignty in their own land: "Ye shall have the joy of seeing the rebuilding of Jerusalem.... When our country shall be in our hands and I offer sacrifice ... we will come to you to bring you to a settled land.... salvation will come soon."30 For Reubeni, Avichail, and Jacobovici, the Jewish diaspora state is an unten- able condition, conceived when the ancient Israelites split into two Kingdoms and born in the Assyrian exile. For them, ten-tribe travel is a directed effort to mend the Jews' fractured existence. It is an endeavor that is intimately linked to a concep- tualization of diaspora as the fleeting present, sandwiched between an enduring and rooted past and future, in which the relationship between people, land, and God was (and will be) unified and whole. UTOPIAN DISPERSION Benjamin of Tudela: Offering Consolation through His Travels We begin our exploration of the theme of utopian dispersion by turning to the writings of Benjamin of Tudela, one of the most famous travelers in Jewish history. He departed from his home in Spain in 1160 to journey across Europe, into the Middle East and then to points further east. Benjamin recorded what he learned through firsthand observations and through information that he gathered from others about the places he did not reach. His account circulated in the Jewish world in manuscript form until the seventeenth century, when a number of editions were printed. The book was reprinted in subsequent centuries, most recently in 1983 and 1995.3' Benjamin never tells the reader the purpose of his journeys or his motivation to write a travelogue. Twentieth-century editors, however, have offered a number of explanations. In his 1907 edition of the travelogue, for example, Marcus Nathan Adler suggests that the trip was primarily undertaken as a pilgrimage to the Land of Israel and that Benjamin's travels to other lands were all incidental to this central aim.32 Alternatively, Adler suggests that Benjamin may have been search- ing for a place where he and his Jewish neighbors might find refuge from their unstable political situation at home. Finally, Adler notes that Benjamin may have been preoccupied with "matters of commercial interest" and wonders whether he might have been traveling to facilitate Jewish trade connections. Nowhere, however, does Adler (or any other scholar) presume that the purpose of Benjamin's trip was to locate the lost tribes. In this sense, his travels are 30. Adler, Jewish Travellers, 310. 31.

Nevertheless, Ben- jamin does claim to have found the tribes along the way, and it is to his descrip- tions of these people that we now turn. Benjamin mentions the lost tribes in two sections of his travelogue. First, he claims to have identified the tribes of Reuven, Gad, and Menasseh in Khaibar.33 Together, they number 50,000, he writes, and among them are both "learned men" and "great warriors." He writes, "They have built strongly-fortified cities, and make war upon all other kingdoms. No man can readily reach their territory, because it is a march of eighteen days' journey through the desert, which is altogether uninhabited, so that no one can enter the land." Benjamin later depicts the tribes of Dan, Zevulun, Asher, and Naphtali, who inhabit the land of Persia on the river Gozan.34 "The extent of their land is twenty days' journey, and they have cities and large villages in the mountains; the river Gozan forms the boundary on the one side. They are not under the rule of the Gentiles, but they have a prince of their own.... There are scholars among them. And they sow and reap and go forth to war...." In both portrayals, the tribes- men include sovereign warriors and scholars who are isolated by natural terrain, desert in one case and a river in the other. Unlike previous descriptions of the tribes, Benjamin's tribesmen do not long for return to the Holy Land. Rather, they are fully at home in their own lands. Furthermore, Benjamin himself does not entertain the notion of reunion between these peoples and Western Jewry. Instead, his tone conveys a sense of respect and awe for these independent people. Benjamin's depiction of these tribesmen fits in well with his general portrait of the Jewish diaspora. He describes more than 150 cities and towns that he passed through (or he learned about from others along the way). He records a Jewish pre- sence in more than 85% of these locales. They are living everywhere, it seems. Moreover, they are living well and maintaining thriving, autonomous communities in all of the lands they inhabit. The Jews of Montpellier, for example, have "houses of learning devoted to the study of Talmud," and among their community are "scholars of eminence," as well as men who are "rich and charitable."35 In Tyre (Lebanon), some Jews are scholars of the Talmud, some own sea vessels, and others are glassmakers whose fine works are "prized in all countries."36 In Baghdad, the Jews "dwell in security, prosperity and honor." In Basra, the Jewish community is composed of "scholars and many rich men,"37 and in Aden, the Jews are "not under the yoke of the Gentiles, but possess cities and castles on the summits of the mountains.., and no man can prevail against them."38 33. Perhaps the region in the vicinity of the Khyber pass of today. Recent writers have identified the Pathan tribes of this area as lost tribesmen. 34.

Cooper Sprinkled throughout these positive descriptions, Benjamin does note a few isolated instances of Jewish communities that suffer oppression. Only in Constan- tinople, though, does he provide a description of Jewish suffering of any length. He explains that the Jews there are not permitted to live in the city proper, nor are they allowed to ride on horseback. Their "condition is low," there is "much hatred against them," and they are often beaten in the streets. How do they contend with their wretched situation? Benjamin answers: "They bear their lot with cheerfulness," and despite hardship, they are "rich and good, kindly and charitable." Benjamin's text mentions-but in no way emphasizes-the messianic long- ings of the Jews he meets during his travels. Although some do make pilgrimage to Jerusalem, there is no sense that they are yearning for the prophesied return to Zion. While visiting Rome, he does take note of mourning over the loss of the Temple. Interestingly, though, it is not the Jews he meets who are grief stricken over the destruction of the Temple; rather, it is the ancient remnants of the Temple itself that mourn. Two bronze columns taken by the Romans when they pillaged Jerusalem are said to exude moisture each year on the ninth of Av (the day of the Temple's destruction). These inanimate architectural pieces cry for their displacement. The Jews, on the other hand, are not seen as suffering from diaspora. They are, in fact, quite at home: They "pay no tribute" to governmental authorities, and they "occupy an honourable position."39 Editor Michael Signer summarizes Benjamin's travelogue as a work of "consolation for the Jewish people." This consolation is framed in terms of his utopian vision of the lost warrior tribesmen, who are strong, brave, learned, and sovereign. It is this description that provides a model for Jews everywhere to contend with their scattered state. They can take solace in knowing that Jews across the world are living in thriving communities and in knowing that anywhere one travels, one can find respected, learned, and wealthy fellow brethren. Just as Jacobovici had a religious revelation brought by his discovery of the ten tribes returning home, we might imagine Benjamin having a religious experience realiz- ing that Jews are scattered the world over, and they are thriving. In this sense, the tribes that he describes are an archetypal example of positive diaspora-not longing to return home, but a celebration of the scattering. David d'Beth Hillel.: Investing the World with a Jewish Presence David d'Beth Hillel was born in Lithuania to a family of rabbis and religious scholars. He moved to Palestine in 1815, and in 1824, he set forth on his lengthy journey. He traveled through the Holy Land and then to Lebanon, Syria, Kurdistan, Iraq, Persia, and India. During this eight-year trip, he recorded some 600 to 700 pages of notes (in Hebrew) about what he saw and learned along the way. While in Madras, India, in 1832, he edited this massive work, translated it into English, and published 300 copies. In 1973, historian Walter Fischel edited and republished the book. 39. Ibid., 63. 108</page><page sequence="15">Conceptualizing Diaspora The travelogue includes a wealth of practical travel data and advice, such as "distances from one place to another; the cost of hiring a boat, a horse, a mule, a camel, or other means of transportation; the lodging places; the amount to be paid for tolls [and] comments on the security of roads [and] bridges."40 Based on these data, Fischel surmises that d'Beth Hillel published his book primarily for British "clergymen, civil servants, and military personnel" who were "anxious to go to the Mediterranean through Arabia."41 This practical goal, however, did not override d'Beth Hillel's intense interest in the lost tribes, and he believed other potential travelers would be intrigued by his curiosity as well. In an advertisement for the book, it was described as "an account of the manners and customs of the places which he has visited, their languages, coins, weights, measures, etc." D'Beth Hillel then added that the book would "throw some light upon the existence and present state of the long lost tribes." In short, it appears that d'Beth Hillel wrote his book primarily as a travel guide, with notes on the lost tribes as a feature of additional interest. But why did d'Beth Hillel really travel? A close reading of the text reveals his keen attunement to the details of the sites, peoples, and landscapes that he encountered-many of which were not Jewish at all-indicating that d'Beth Hillel traveled simply because he wanted "to see the world."42 Indeed, he was intrigued and highly preoccupied with the lost tribes, but this fascination must be read and understood in the context of his general travel interests. Let us turn first to a few examples that illustrate d'Beth Hillel's desire to "see the world" in its many facets. In Damascus, he writes of the architecture: "The rich people's houses are painted inside with silver and gold.... The court [yard]s of the houses are floored with large marble stones of four different colors...."43 In Aleppo, he writes of the people and their culture: "I witnessed there a curious custom. The Mahometans in their ... festivals ... bring large copper pots filled up with wine and liquor, and in them great copper cups; these they place in the midst of the congregation and everybody drinks according to this desire."44 And in Kurdistan, he writes of the natural landscape: "On the banks ... [of the river] are stones of different colours, which are very curious to look at. I stayed for about three hours, and examined them."45 Given d'Beth Hillel's varied interests, it is not surprising that his infor- mation on Jewish populations is contextualized within a broader discussion of demographics. In Beirut, for example, he writes that there are about 15 families of "Israelite merchants," 2,000 families of "Nazerenes" (Christians), and 20,000 40. Walter Fischel, Unknown Jews in Unknown Lands: The Travels of Rabbi David d'Beth Hillel 1824-1832 (New York: Ktav Publishing, 1973), 15. 41. Ibid. 42. These are the words d'Beth Hillel himself used in response to the Rajah of Satar in India, who asked him to explain his impetus for travel. See Fischel, Unknown Jews in Unknown Lands, 14. 43. Ibid., 65-66. 44. Not only does d'Beth Hillel take note of this custom, he also takes an active interest in it, questioning how the locals, as Muslims, condone the drinking of alcohol. "I have enquired about this, and was answered that Mahomet did not command the not-drinking of wine in this town." Ibid., 71. 45. Ibid., 81. 109</page><page sequence="16">Alanna E. Cooper families of "Mahometans" (Muslims). And in Damascus, he writes that there are 200 families of Israelites, 2,000 families of Nazerenes, and about 150,000 families of Mahometans.46 The Jews, in other words, are but one segment of the world that d'Beth Hillel notices and describes. And yet, what is so intriguing about our author is that despite his wide-angle view, which captures so many different features of the social and natural land- scape, his Jewishness inescapably informs his travel experiences. Occasionally, it proves to be an obstacle, as on one winter night he spent in a village in Persia: "Nobody would receive me into a house for any money I offered them," he writes, "saying that the house would be defiled.... because they knew me to be a Jew." Other times, it proves to be an asset, as on a bridge-crossing, where a poll was generally taken: "But I did not pay it because the collector of it was a Jew from Baghdad who knew me."47 And sometimes he was able to slip by unnoticed. Yet even when he passed as a non-Jew, he himself was highly conscious of how (or whether) his Jewishness would be perceived by others. "They did not regard me on the road as a Jew," he writes about his trip to Meshed, "for if they had known me as such I should have been destroyed."48 Just as his identity as a Jew shaped the way he experienced the world throughout his travels, so, too, did his religious sensibilities. In particular, he was steeped in biblical literature, and these texts informed the way he understood the sites and people he encountered. For example, he identifies many of the cities and towns he passed through with biblical references; Sidon in Lebanon is where he believes Zebulon, the son of patriarch Jacob, was buried.49 And Halab (Aleppo), Syria, is where he surmises "our forefather Abraham" used to milk his flocks.50 So, too, he traces the history of many archeological sites to the Bible. In Urfa, Kurdistan, for example, he visits a water reservoir "built of large white marble stones [and] very deep." It is here, d'Beth Hillel reports, that King Nimrod threw Abraham into the kiln and where Abraham was saved when "the Lord changed [the kiln] into a tank."51 D'Beth Hillel also surmises that many of the customs of the people he meets are referenced in the Bible. In India, for example, he describes a festival of "great joy among all the people," held after the monsoon season, when ships begin to sail again. He traces the practices associated with this festival to the book of Habakkuk, which contains a vague reference to rejoicing by the sea.52 Finally, d'Beth Hillel traces the origins of some of the people he meets to biblical references. And this brings us to his discussions of the lost tribes: While visiting the Jewish community of Sitya, Kurdistan, he notices that the town is situated not far from a river called Halah. He surmises that this is the 46. Ibid., 66-67. 47. Ibid., 92. 48. Ibid., 91. 49. Ibid., 62-63. 50. Based on the consonance of "Halab" and the Hebrew halav (milk). Ibid., 69. 51. Ibid., 72. 52.

There is "no difference between them and the Arabs in appearance," he writes. They are, however, "separate by eating, customs, and marriages," and they pray in a synagogue. Overall, he summarizes "they are very ignorant of the Hebrew language and customs" and thus concludes, "I conceive that they must be some of the lost Ten Tribes."54 Similarly, he notes that the Jewish community in Shush, Kurdistan, is situated along a river called Gosen and located not far from Media (also names reminiscent of those listed in the Kings II verse). He describes these Jews, like those in Sitya, as "very ignorant of the Hebrew language and customs," and he concludes that they are also among the lost tribes. D'Beth Hillel's treatments of the Jews of Ethiopia, Bukhara, Georgia, Daghestan, and Persia follow a similar pattern. Although he does not identify each group with a particular geographical reference in the Bible, he does deem them all "ignorant of the Hebrew language and customs" and thus concludes that they are all lost tribesmen. With such scant evidence, why is d'Beth Hillel convinced that he has found the lost tribes? What is it about the legend that is so compelling for him? First, he is negotiating an understanding of these people who are Jewish and who are, therefore, his "brethren" but whose appearances, practices, and manners are so different from his own that it is difficult to recognize them as family. Identi- fying them as "lost tribes" provides a framework for negotiating this dilemma. In essence, the story of the lost tribes accommodates the centrifugal forces of diaspora history. They are tales about those whose history unfolded far away and disconnected from Palestine and eastern Europe-the locales that form the center of d'Beth Hillel's own Jewish life. As such, they offered him a lens through which to view the Jews of Kurdistan, Ethiopia, Bukhara, Georgia, Daghestan, and Persia as part of the Jewish social universe despite the fact that they are so different from what he recognized as Jewish. Second, by using the features of the natural landscape to help him identify these groups as "lost tribes," d'Beth Hillel overlays contemporary geography onto the biblical map. In this way, the terrain that he passes over, which is so distant from his home, remains part of his world. His interpretation orients him, imbuing the distant and strange with a sense of familiarity, even Jewishness. D'Beth Hillel's view of the world as permeated with Jewishness is further highlighted by his identification of two additional groups as "lost tribes" despite the fact that they do not view themselves as part of the Jewish people. The first are those who live in tents in the "wilderness, which is between Damascus, Egypt, Yemen, Mecca and Median." Anyone who wishes to pass through this region unharmed must pay tribute to these people, whom the locals call the "Jews of Khaibar" and whom d'Beth Hillel identifies as tribe of Dan. Drawing on other far-fetched information, another group he identifies as a lost tribe are 53. See note 23. 54. Ibid., 74. 111</page><page sequence="18">Alanna E. Cooper India's Hindus, whose "purification and mourning ceremonies.... bear a strong resemblance to those of the Israelites."55 For d'Beth Hillel, finding the lost tribes was not meant to be a step toward the gathering of the exiles, to preempt their return to the Holy Land, or even to alleviate an anxiety related to not knowing the fate of his "brethren." Rather, iden- tifying the lost tribes was about investing the entire world-or at least everywhere that he traveled-with Jewish presence. Eldad the Danite: From a Powerful Tribe with Its Own Talmud During the mid-800s, almost 1,200 years ago, a traveler by the name of Eldad left his home-the Land of the tribe of Dan-and traveled west by sea. Along the way, a cannibal people captured the vessel in which he was traveling. They consumed Eldad's traveling companion but spared him, as he had suffered from seasickness and become very thin. They imprisoned Eldad and fed him well, with the hopes of fattening him up. Before he reached the optimal weight for consumption, however, these cannibal people were overrun by another people who-once again-spared Eldad. He lived among them for several years until he was sold to the tribe of Issachar. After living among Issachar for some time, Eldad traveled further west to North Africa. There, he encountered Jews who were descendants of Benjamin and Judah-the tribes of the Southern Kingdom.56 It was here, among these long-lost foreign brethren, that Eldad told the tale of his travels. So, too, he provided them with an ethnographic description of life among the tribesmen. Finally, he gave a detailed review of his fellow tribesmen's religious law. All of this was recorded and then circulated in manuscript form among the Jewish communities of the Middle East and North Africa. As early as 1480, it was brought to print in Italy, and since then, many versions of the story have been printed and reprinted. How much of the details of the Eldad story are fact and how much are fiction has been the subject of great academic debate. Regardless, of where the truth lies, it offers a complex commentary on the Jewish diaspora condition. We may begin to unpack this commentary by examining Eldad's description of how the tribe of Dan became separated from the rest of the Jewish world. He explains that unlike the other nine tribes of the Northern Kingdom, the Danites were not carried away into captivity by the Assyrians. In fact, some 200 years before the Assyrian invasion, Jerobam, ruler of the Northern Kingdom, engaged the Southern Kingdom in war in an effort to consolidate his rule. Knowing the Danites' reputation as excellent warriors, he called on them for their support. They flatly refused, however, proclaiming, "We will not make war with our brothers and we will not shed blood." This declaration became the Danites' founding principle. They recognized that sharing a common territory necessarily involves the negotiation of power. Uninterested in engaging in an effort to consolidate authority, they left. This 55. Ibid., 117. 56. A. Neubauer, "Where Are the Ten Tribes," 95-114; and Elkan Nathan Adler, "Eldad the Danite," in Jewish Travellers in the Middle Ages (New York: Dover, 1987), 4-21. 112</page><page sequence="19">Conceptualizing Diaspora point-their privileging peaceful division over turbulent unity-becomes central as the story unfolds. When the Danites left the Holy Land, they were unsure of their destination. They first arrived to Egypt and considered settling there. However, when they recalled the Torah's proclamation, "Ye shall not continue to see it [Egypt] again, forever," they decided against it. Instead, they passed through the land and arrived at borders of Kush.57 They entered, taking the land "by might," and then forced the native peoples to pay them tribute. This story is an inversion of the common narrative of exile. The Danites are not forced into exile but rather leave of their own accord. They consider settling in Egypt, but they remember that that they are not to revisit the land of their oppression and servitude. Unwilling to suffer enslavement to the will of others, they take total control of their own destiny through might and prowess. Eldad goes on to explain that the Danites did not remain the only Israelites in Kush for long. When the Assyrians conquered northern Israel, the tribes of Naphtali, Gad, and Asher also fled to Kush. There, they joined the tribe of Dan, where all four tribes live in harmony. Together, they own "sheep and cattle and asses," they "sow and reap," and they are rich in luxuries such as gold, silver and precious stones. They are constantly engaged in battle with the surrounding peoples and have established a rotating war service: Each of the four tribes fights for three months of each year. When each group returns from battle, they bring their spoils to their king, who divides them among all four tribes. These tribesmen can hardly be called "lost." They are a powerful, autonomous people who know exactly who and where they are. So, too, in their religious practice, they have a sense of independent assurance. In fact, they follow their own Talmud rather than the Talmud redacted in either Babylonia or Palestine. It is this particular point-the existence of another Talmud, composed in a far-off land-that most disturbed Eldad's listeners. Its implications are indeed heretical because of its challenge to rabbinic authority. Several nineteenth- century critics were also greatly disturbed by Eldad's claim of another Talmud. Some surmised that he actually must have been a "cunning imposter": a Karaite who disguised himself as a lost tribesman so as to proselytize without arousing the wrath of the rabbinic world. Rather than dismiss the Eldad story as a tale of heresy, we might examine one particular segment in the narrative that suggests it is actually about coming to terms with the difficulty of maintaining centralized religious authority in the diaspora: The segment opens with a sea voyage and then switches to a strange account of Eldad's experience of being taken hostage and later sold for ransom to the tribe of Issachar. These details are echoed in the story of the four captives, told by twelfth-century Jewish historian Abraham Ibn Daoud. Ibn Daoud's story goes like this: Four scholars of the Babylonian Academy were at sea when their vessel was captured and they were taken captive. All four of them were ransomed: Rabbi Moses to the Jewish community of Spain, Rabbi Hushiel to the Jewish community of Tunisia, Rabbi Shemariah to the Jewish community of Egypt, 57. This has been identified by some as Ethiopia. 113</page><page sequence="20">Alanna E. Cooper and the other's fate is unknown. Each of these scholars became an important leader in his new community, where each established a center of Jewish creativity and religious authority.58 Modem historians explain that the story told by Ibn Daoud is a polemical argument designed to legitimate the leaders of these three communities (Spain, Egypt, and Tunisia) as rightful heirs to the Babylonian tradition. Yet, paradoxically, Ibn Daoud cowers at the implications of this dispersal of authority in the wake of the Babylonian center's decline. Unable to contend with the notion that there is no longer a single "center," Ibn Daoud privileges the Jewish community of Spain above Egypt and Tunisia. He writes, "all [religious] questions which had formerly been addressed to the academies [of Babylon] were now directed to him [Rabbi Moses, who had been ransomed to the Jewish community of Spain]."59 Like Ibn Daoud's four captives, Eldad journeys by sea, is taken hostage, and is ransomed to a Jewish community. This evocative shared imagery draws atten- tion to the fact that one story is actually an inversion of the other. Ibn Daoud's tale identifies a "center" and assigns primacy to it. For him, the center is the legitimate heir of the oral tradition, and it holds the Jewish world together through the maintenance of a normative, authentic religion. The Eldad story, on the other hand, suggests that there is no center, nor is there a singular heir to tradition. Significantly, once the notion of "center" is dismissed as irrelevant, there can no longer be people who are marginal or peripheral. From this decentered perspective, the "lost" tribes are no longer lost at all. Eldad has no difficulty with the dispersion of religious authority or with the scattered existence of the Jewish people. Indeed, he understands that attempts at centralization necessarily involve the negotiation of power. And though he and his people are quite willing to war with other nations, they are uninterested in engaging in such contests of supremacy with their own. The Danites' decision to flee Israel rather than go to war with the Southern Kingdom is thoroughly con- sistent with their understanding that there can be more than one Talmud. So, too, it is consistent with the notion that there can be more than one place that is home. In their descriptions of their ten-tribe travels, Benjamin, d'Beth Hillel, and Eldad all celebrate the scattering of the Jewish people. Benjamin's depiction of the lost tribes as sovereign warriors and scholars highlights his emphasis on the achievements and successes of the Jews dispersed throughout the world. D'Beth Hillel's and Eldad's interests in the lost tribes, on the other hand, focus on the negotiation of Jewish peoplehood and religion in the diaspora context. For d'Beth Hillel, the term "lost tribesmen" is used as a catch-all for those groups that have been separated from the centers of Jewish life for so long that they have deviated from rabbinic Judaism as he knows it. He is ambivalent about how to relate to these people. On one hand, he does not describe their local customs in any detail. Rather than celebrate the great range of Jewish prac- tices, he dismisses the differences that he encounters as "ignorance." On the other 58. Gerson D. Cohen, The Book of Tradition (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1967), 63-66. 59. Ibid., 66. 114</page><page sequence="21">Conceptualizing Diaspora hand, he appears uninterested in the possibility of the return of these people into the fold of "mainstream" Judaism or the possibility of their physical return to the homeland. To the contrary, like Benjamin of Tudela, he offers his readers comfort in the notion that the Jews are widely dispersed and that the world is infused with their presence. Like d'Beth Hillel, Eldad the Danite is preoccupied with the implications of Jewish scattering. Unlike d'Beth Hillel, however, he is clear and unambivalent about his view of the centrifugal forces of diaspora. As a tribesman himself, he represents the possibility that Jews need not be a unitary people with a normative religion. Rather, he celebrates the dispersion of religious authority and presents a decentered view of "home" as a legitimate option. CONCLUSION In this essay, I have argued that the tales of the ten-tribe travelers can be divided into two distinct frames of reference for making sense of the Jewish dia- spora condition. One celebrates the scattering of the people and the dispersion of both religious authority and the notion of home; the other regards diaspora as a problematic state and calls for the return of a centralized authority and homeland. In fact, these two paradigms of Jewish diaspora are actually more complex than this oppositional structure implies, for they are not unequivocal in their assertions. Rather, each contains whispers of the other. These quiet but significant voices can be heard in a number of problematic segments in the travel texts of Eldad, Benjamin, and Jacobovici. One such problematic segment is found in the closing remarks of the Eldad text. In the version printed in Mantua, Italy, around 1480, the narrator concludes, "And this is my name, Eldad ben Mahali ben Ezekiel ben Hezekiah....ben Husim ben Dan ben Jacob our father, on whom be peace and on all Israel."60 Some sixty years later, Eldad's story was reprinted in Venice, Italy. Interestingly, the narrator of this version is a North African Jew from the community that had received Eldad after his long travels. Written from the point of view of the host community, the text concludes, "Now the name of this pious man who came to us is Eldad, son of Mahli, son of Ezechiel, son of Hezekiah ... son of Hushim, son of Dan, son of Jacob our father." At this point, rather than ending with the simple prayer for peace on Israel-as Eldad did-the narrator writes, "The Holy One, blessed be he, who made us to know good tidings concerning our brethren the Ten Tribes, he will gather our scattered ones from the four comers of the earth to the Temple together with all of Israel's brethren. Amen."61 Eldad explicitly legitimizes a decentralized Jewish social universe in his version of the text. Eldad' s listeners, however, are not fully convinced by his message. They continue to pray for the reunification of the Jewish people in their common home. The tradition bequeathed to contemporary readers is thus contradictory and unresolved. 60.

Cooper Similarly, Benjamin of Tudela's text ends on a note of tension. Like Eldad, he celebrates the scattering of the Jews and emphasizes their character as mighty warriors and sovereign people. Nevertheless, he (or those who edited and rewrote his text) could not refrain from offering a prayer for the return of the children of Israel to their homeland. Toward the very end of his travelogue, the following message appears: All Israel is dispersed in every land, and he who does not further the gathering of Israel will not meet with happiness. When the Lord will remember us in our exile, and raise the horn of his anointed, then every one will say, "I will lead the Jews and I will gather them." This paragraph is strangely out of place within the context of Benjamin's overall message. Its anomalous nature is further pronounced given the particular spot in which it appears. At the very end of his journeys, on his way back to Spain, Benjamin passed through Germany and recorded a few notes about the Jews there. He wrote, And the following are the cities in the land of Alamannia, which have Hebrew congregations: Metz, Treves on the river Moselle, Coblenz, Andernach, Bonn, Cologne, Bingen, Munster, and Worms.... In addition to the several cities which we have mentioned there are besides Strassburg, Wurzburg, Mantern, Bamberg, Freising and Regensburg at the extremity of the Empire. In these cities there are many Israelites, wise and rich men.62 This text reads as though it is uninterrupted. Yet, it is here-within the ellipses-that the entire paragraph about the "gathering of Israel" is contained. Perhaps the paragraph in question did not appear in the original text and was inserted by a later editor.63 Or perhaps it is a standard formula that accompanies descriptions of the world's Jewish communities in such a requisite manner that it can be inserted anywhere. Regardless of how these few sentences found their way into Benjamin's travelogue, it is clear that even when dispersion is celebrated, the yearning for reunion in Zion remains powerful. But this is not the final word, for in Jacobovici's narrative, we encounter the inverse phenomena. He depicts the ten tribes as displaced in their diaspora lands and portrays them as homeward bound. In particular, he focuses on the Bnei Menashe in Manipur. Their longing for Zion is well stated by one woman, who explains, "We want to go back to where we belong ... to our fatherland Israel." Following this clip, Jacobovici offers a strangely incongruous perspective on 62. Signer, The Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela, 138-39. 63. Adler suggests that this text was, in fact, a "late interpolation" (The Itinerary of Tudela, 80). The earliest versions of the text that I inspected were a 1633 printed edition (Itinerarium D. Beniaminis Cum Verfione &amp; Notis, Acad. Lugd. Batav) and a microfilm version of a 1543 manuscript edition (Masa 'ot Shel Rabi Benyamin, Constantinople). Both of these contain the paragraph under discussion. The text's evolution between the twelfth century (when Benjamin traveled) and the sixteenth century is still an open question. 116</page><page sequence="23">Conceptualizing Diaspora the Bnei Menashe. He turns to focus on a group of young men carrying rifles and clothed in army fatigues. They are Bnei Menashe guerilla soldiers, who speak of their territorial war with their neighbors the Naga who also live in Manipur. One explains, "[We] Israelites are good fighters ... we are not afraid to fight." The nar- rator continues by explaining that these warriors are "dedicated to setting up an independent Israelite state in India," and the scene concludes with a clip of the sol- diers unfurling the flag of the "future sovereign state"-a flag that features a Star of David at its center. Jacobovici, like Benjamin, is torn. Benjamin's text expresses pride in the fiercely independent warrior tribes but never gives up on the powerful messianic suggestion that these tribes, regardless of their strength and autonomy, should leave their diaspora homes and return "Home." Jacobovici's ambivalence parallels Benjamin's but appears as a mirror reflection. Exuberant that the Bnei Menashe are headed back to the Holy Land, he nevertheless expresses pride in those among them who, rather than choosing migration to Israel, put up a heroic fight to make Mizoram their legitimate home. The mythical story of the lost tribes then is not just about two contested visions of diaspora: utopic return and utopic dispersion. It is also about the way in which each of these visions equivocates, incorporating an undertone of its inverse. Rather than conveying a clear message, the ambivalent narrative encom- passes the tensions of the Jewish diaspora condition as it relates to questions about home, religious authority, and peoplehood.
