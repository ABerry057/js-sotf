Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2005. vi, 203 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000700 Scholars who choose to publish synthetic works of history face a daunting task. They must sift through the claims and counterclaims of fellow historians (sometimes their own teachers, colleagues, and students), provide cogent sum maries of vast bodies of work, and negotiate a delicate balance between faithful 396</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews representation of others' writing and their own original insight and analysis. Israel Bartal, a leading scholar of eastern European Jewry, has admirably succeeded in providing such a synthesis. His book is based on a series of lectures he gave on Israel Defense Forces Radio; therefore, it is aimed primarily at an educated lay public, though it will be enormously helpful to students and scholars in the field of eastern European Jewish history as a "gathering house" of key arguments and controversies. Its originality lies not in archival discoveries or original research but in the lucid presentation and analysis of current scholarship in the field. For those familiar with the vast historical scholarship on the Jewish encoun ter with modernity, Bartal's claims will either be welcomed as refreshingly unconventional or condemned as maddeningly unorthodox, depending on one's inclination (this reviewer leans decisively toward the former). Indeed, part of what makes The Jews of Eastern Europe especially interesting is that it is informed by an implicitly (and at times explicitly) revisionist spirit. To take one example, Bartal challenges the central role that the Haskalah occupies in standard historical narratives of the Jewish encounter with the modem world, arguing that the Haska lah "was not a cause but rather an effect of modernization," just one response of Jewish society to various processes of modernization: the rise of capitalism and subsequent decline of the feudal economy; immigration and urbanization; the decline of Jewish autonomy; and, most crucially for him, the interference of the modem state in the internal life of the Jews (96). It was not the maskilim who undermined the foundations of traditional Jewish society but the reforms carried out by centralized states seeking to integrate Jews into the political and economic order, as well as large, impersonal economic forces that brought about the end of the rural leasing economy on which that society had been based for centuries (120-21, 162-63). Bartal also calls into question the emphasis on Germany and German Jews in standard narrative accounts that depict the modernization of eastern European Jewish society (and eastern Europe in general) as resulting from the spread of Western influence from the center of Europe to the passive per iphery in the East. According to his counternarrative, the Haskalah was an "all Ashkenazi phenomenon" that emerged simultaneously in several centers in central and eastern Europe and was rooted in the intensive contact between the two parts of the Ashkenazi diaspora (91). The central focus of the book is the tremendous impact that the partitions of Poland during the late eighteenth century had on eastern European Jewry. The dis solution of the Polish-Lithuanian kingdom and the subsequent absorption of the most populous Jewish community in the world into the Prussian, Austrian, and Russian empires led to a fateful encounter between the Jews of Poland and the apparatus of the centralized state in the form of Russian officialdom in White Russia, Austrian bureaucracy in Galicia, and the Prussian administration in western Prussia (Bartal chooses not to explore the latter). He argues that for Polish Jews, the modem era commenced with this encounter, notwithstanding the fact that most of those in the annexed area continued to maintain their tra ditional way of life (1). This community underwent profound changes that shat tered centuries-old traditions and social structures: Governmental authority sought to crush the power of autonomous Jewish communities; the rise of 397</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews capitalism brought about the decline of the feudal lease-holding system on which those communities had long depended, as well as a gradual (and later precipitous) decline in the power and status of their allies among the Polish aristocracy; and new types of capitalistic entrepreneurs, industrialists, bankers, and merchants began appearing in larger Jewish communities. If Bartal is correct that this process of modernization began with the fundamental transformation of social, economic, and political life ushered in by the first Polish partition in 1772, then the notion that eastern European Jewish modernity began in the second or third decade of the nineteenth century, a "belated" response to intellectual currents that had begun in Germany much earlier and made their way eastward, must be seriously revised. Bartal's book begins by describing the essential characteristics of Jewish life in the Polish-Lithuanian kingdom and then traces the history of three parallel paths of Polish Jewry in Austrian Galicia, semiautonomous Congress Poland, and the Russian empire after the partitions. He examines how the very different political conditions that existed in each area shaped the development of Jewish society in distinct ways, but he is also careful to take note of continuities and shared characteristics, arguing that despite the separation imposed by new political boundaries, several elements of traditional Jewish life?most notably, economic activity and relations with Polish nobles?remained unchanged long after the dis appearance of Poland from the map of Europe in 1795 (35-36). This continuity had ancient roots in the social, cultural, and religious unity of the Ashkenazi dia spora and later became the basis for modem Jewish nationalism (12). After tracing the evolution of postpartition Polish Jewry during the course of the nineteenth century, Bartal concludes with an account of the pogroms of 1881-82. Here, too, his interpretation is innovative, challenging the notion that those events caused a dramatic leap from premodem conditions to an entirely new phase in the history of eastern European Jewry. Bartal points to the profound transformation of social and economic conditions that had been taking place during the decades before the pogroms, particularly the disintegration of the feudal lease holding system, as the primary cause of the profound upheaval that undermined the foundations of traditional Jewish life. "The pogroms of in the Pale of Settlement were, in a sense, a by-product of political, economic, and social processes rather than a major cause of these processes" (5, 142). While conceding that 1881 can be viewed as a turning point in Jewish history, his focus is on lines of continuity and gradual processes rather than sudden rupture and revolutionary change. Perhaps because the book is based on lectures that were originally intended for a radio audience, it contains numerous repetitions of facts, sometimes on the same page or within the same paragraph. Although these repetitions help clarify and reinforce points made orally, they become somewhat tiresome for the reader. More substantively, this reviewer wishes that Professor Bartal had pro vided a more detailed explanation of his views on maskilim. They are depicted in his account as cultural agents of the Russian and Austrian empires who regarded the modem state as "a historical innovation unparalleled in the history of human kind," and hence collaborated with government officials in order to remake "Jews" into "men" (91-92). This depiction contrasts sharply with that of Shmuel Feiner, 398</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews to take one example, whose The Jewish Enlightenment portrays maskilim as the defenders of enlightened values and as engaging in a heroic struggle against the reactionary rabbinic establishment.1 The problem is not that Bartal's account is unfair or inaccurate but that his views remain implicit and undertheorized. On what empirical and interpretive grounds do his rather negative characterization of the maskilim rest? His claim that the language employed by the Haskalah con cealed "the unpleasant assumption that a member of the traditional Ashkenazi Jewish community ... was not a man" requires further explanation, for it hints at a larger critique of Enlightenment discourse and practice. A direct engagement with more positive scholarly assessments (such as Feiner's) could shed light on a fascinating historiographical dispute. Notwithstanding these quibbles, Bartal's book is a superb synthetic work of scholarship on the modem history of Polish Jewry. The fact that specialists in the field may already be aware of many of its arguments does not lessen its value for educated lay readers or for advanced students and scholars of the Jews of Poland who seek a lucid, expertly constructed overview of the subject.
